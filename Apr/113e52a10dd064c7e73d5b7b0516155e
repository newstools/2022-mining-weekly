Canadian company Excellon Resources has resolved the labour action at its Platosa mine, Mexico, and resumed production on Friday. President and CEO Brendan Cahill reported that the labour action would impact on its first-quarter production and financial results, but that the company intended to continue the solid production realised in January and February into the second quarter. The Sindicato Nacional Minero Metalúrgico started a labour action at Platosa in early March., despite agreeing in-principle on the terms of the 2022 collective bargaining arrangement. Cahill thanked Platosa’s staff and workers for their perseverance in moving this issue through to a resolution. “We hope to resume our longstanding positive relationship with the Sindicato Nacional Minero Metalúrgico through the remainder of the mining operation.”
