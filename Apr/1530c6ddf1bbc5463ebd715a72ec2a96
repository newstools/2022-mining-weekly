London-listed Polyus has appointed Alexey Vostokov as its new CEO, succeeding Pavel Grachev, who the gold miner says has stepped down from his role to focus on his own business projects. Grachev has served as the company’s CEO since 2014. He also resigned from the board of directors. Vostokov joined Polyus in 2014. Since then, he has held a number of executive positions within the company’s corporate division. Being the head of the corporate division, Vostokov was actively involved in a number of landmark transactions at Polyus, including the Polyus Re-IPO and the acquisition of Sukhoi Log deposit. The company recently launched a search for potential candidates to fill the roles of independent directors on its board of directors. On March 9, days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Edward Dowling, Maria Gordon, Kent Potter and William Champion resigned from the Polyus board, citing an inability to execute their governance function given the market circumstances. Last week, Russian businessman Said Kerimov also resigned from the board of directors of Polyus. Polyus is Russia's biggest gold miner, with operations in Siberia and the Russian Far East: Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk and Magadan regions and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).
