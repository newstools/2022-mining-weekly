PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Triton Minerals has identified a power solution for its Ancuabe graphite project, in Mozambique, signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with generator manufacturer Himoinsa Southern Africa. The MoU will see the development of a modular, scalable, cost-effective and sustainable power solution for the Ancuabe project, with Himoinsa to develop, build, own, operate and maintain the power generation facilities. The MoU covers a small-scale Stage 1 startup operation, and a Stage 2 expansion to full capacity. Stage 1 would require energy to power a processing plant with a capacity of between 100 000 t/y and 125 000 t/y of ore, producing between 5 000 t/y and 8 000 t/y of graphite concentrate, with Himoinsa to supply 1.5 MW of diesel-powered electrical generation and potentially a solar/battery hybrid energy solution. Stage 1 is likely to be operational by the third quarter of 2023. The Stage 2 expansion would scale up the supply of energy to between 5 MW and 6 MW, with the addition of both diesel and solar/battery hybrid energy solutions, and potentially backed by connection to the grid. The Stage 2 expansion is expected to start in 2025, with processing targeted at one-million tonnes a year for the production of up to 60 000 t/y of graphite concentrate. “This MoU marks an important step in our commercial pilot plant development at our flagship Ancuabe project,” said Triton MD Andrew Frazer. “We are very excited to be working with the highly credentialed Himoinsa group. The supply of power is crucial to the success of a mining project and particularly at the early stages of the project development, the Himoinsa solutions will provide the Anucabe project with flexibility and reliability.”
