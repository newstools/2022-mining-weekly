Aim-listed Caracal Gold has appointed Sheila Boit as business development executive. Boit has extensive experience working in Kenya in the sustainable construction and materials industry, having worked as sales and specification manager in East Africa for London-listed Serge Ferrari, the company points out. She holds a Master of Business Administration in Global Business & Sustainability from the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, in Italy. Moreover, Jason Brewer will be retiring from his role as commercial director, effective immediately, to focus on other work commitments.  He will continue to work closely with the company, retaining an ongoing role as a consultant. “We are delighted to welcome Sheila to the team. Her extensive experience in the region and excellent business acumen makes her an ideal candidate as we look to build our East African gold operations and the profile of our company. “While we welcome Sheila, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Jason for his hard work and commitment to the company.  We wish him well in his new endeavours and are delighted that he will continue to support the company in a new consultant capacity,” says Caracal CE Robbie McCrae. "This year is a crucial one for Caracal as we implement a number of initiatives to build production output, with 24 000 t/y targeted at our flagship Kilimapesa gold mine, in Kenya.  We look forward to delivering on this with our newly strengthened team,” he adds.
