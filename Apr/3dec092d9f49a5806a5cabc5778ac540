Finnish explorer and developer Keliber has been granted the building permit for its lithium chemical plant in Kokkola, paving the way for construction to start this summer. The plant will convert Keliber’s spodumene concentrate to battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate, used in electric vehicle batteries, among other things. Keliber, in which South Africa-based Sibanye-Stillwater is a large shareholder, said it aims to start production at the chemical plant in 2024.
