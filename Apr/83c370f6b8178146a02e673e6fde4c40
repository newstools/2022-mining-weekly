PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Sihayo Gold is hoping to raise A$11.7-million through a pro-rata non-renounceable entitlement offer of four fully paid shares for every five shares held by eligible shareholders. The entitlement offer will be priced at 0.4c a share, and will open on May 4 and close on May 13.
