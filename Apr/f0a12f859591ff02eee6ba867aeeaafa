PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Nickel miner Panoramic Resources has continued to increase production at its Savannah nickel operations, in Western Australia, following commissioning in October of last year. Mined ore tonnage from Savannah increased by 42% quarter on quarter, to 108 266 t, while the tonnage of ore milled increased by 20%, to 148 709 t. Concentrate production in the March quarter increased by 57% on the December quarter, to 17 498 t, containing 1 256 t of nickel, 802 t of copper and 81 t of cobalt. Panoramic said on Wednesday that the increase in production during the March quarter was supported by the easing of border restrictions in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during the quarter which increased labour availability from some 70% to nearly 90%. The increased availability of underground operators has seen the mining sequence revert to a more balanced profile between underground development and stope ore production to support the ramp up to steady-state operations as planned, the miner said. “The relaxation of state border restrictions was a welcome development during the quarter, improving site labour availability during an important ramp-up phase at the mine,” said MD and CEO Victor Rajasooriar. “The team at site remains firmly focussed on the safe ramp up of operations as we move toward steady-state production. As the ramp up continues, we are pleased to have been able to end the March quarter with a higher cash balance compared to the previous quarter.” Savannah continued to operate in the quarter in the precommercial production phase of its development where both the mining and processing operations are ramping up to commercial levels, and total site expenditure for the quarter was A$41.1-million.
