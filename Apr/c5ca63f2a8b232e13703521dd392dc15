Global gold and copper miner Barrick Gold Corporation has advised of a water leak at its North Mara mine, in Tanzania, but says it has found no reason for concern for the community or aquatic biodiversity of a nearby river. The company explains that the mine has experienced an uncontrolled release of low-quality water to the environment, following an unexpected failure of a water transfer pipeline along the haul road between the Gokona and Rama operations. Barrick confirms that the appropriate authorities have been notified and says the company is working alongside them to monitor the affected environment. Although the water release was minor, the North Mara environmental team immediately sampled the receiving waterbodies. The preliminary water quality results show there is no immediate impact on the waterbodies and no risk is posed to the community or the aquatic biodiversity of the river. The company affirms it will supply water to the community, should it become necessary. Barrick will continue sampling over the next few days and report its findings accordingly.
