London-listed Endeavour Mining has announced it will soon start construction on the expanded Sabodala-Massawa project, in Senegal. A definitive feasibility study on the expansion project confirms it can incorporate a 1.2-million-tonne Biox plant to process high-grade refractory ore from the Massawa deposits, alongside the main 4.2-million-tonne-a-year carbon-in-leach plant. This expansion will yield incremental production of 1.35-million ounces of gold at a low all-in sustaining cost of $576/oz over the life of the expansion project. Sabodala-Massawa is poised to produce an average 373 000 oz/y over the next five years. The expansion project will cost about $290-million and will be self-funded by the existing Sabodala-Massawa operation. It has an after-tax internal rate of return of 72% and a net present value of $861-million. The Biox plant has a quick 1.4-year payback period and is expected to generate $200-million of free cash flow a year during its first five years of operation. First gold from the Biox plant is anticipated in early 2024. Meanwhile, Endeavour remains on track to discover its targeted 2.3-million to 2.7-million ounces of indicated resources at the Sabodala-Massawa project over the 2021 to 2025 period.
