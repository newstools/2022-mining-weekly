PERTH (miningweekly.com) – A scoping study into an underground operation at the Mt Carbine tungsten mine, in Queensland, has demonstrated the potential for a long-life, economically viable project. ASX-listed EQ Resources on Tuesday told shareholders that the scoping study demonstrated that underground mining could be done in parallel to opencut operations. The scoping study targeted a 1 500 t/d operation with a mine life of some ten years, and EQ Resources will now proceed with prefeasibility work. EQ Resources CEO Kevin MacNeill said the results of the scoping are pleasing and demonstrated the potential to significantly increase production at Mt Carbine post the mining of the proposed openpit. “The scoping study supports the potential technical and financial viability for an underground operation which could form part of Mt Carbine’s long-term plan for sustainable tungsten production. The work performed will allow EQ Resources to follow up in a clear direction with a prefeasibility study assessment. “With the potential underground operation being part of the Mt Carbine development targets, we are taking another key step towards becoming one of the world’s top tier tungsten producers.” An earlier bankable feasibility study into the openpit project estimated that it would require a capital investment of A$19-million to support a 12-year operation.
