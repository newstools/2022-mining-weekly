SAO PAULO - Brazilian holding J&F Investimentos has agreed to acquire Vale's iron-ore and manganese mines in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul for one-billion reais ($215- million), newspaper Valor Economico reported late on Tuesday. The figure to be paid by J&F, parent company of meatpacker JBS and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil, includes the ventures' debt, Valor said, citing market sources familiar with the matter. J&F and Vale did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Vale announced last week it was in advanced talks to sell the companies that compose its Center-West system as it looks to focus on core businesses and growth opportunities.
