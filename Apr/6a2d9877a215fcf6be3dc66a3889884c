Industry organisation the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) is encouraging investment in and use of platinum-based technologies that are helping to support greener operations, industries and economies. In a short video marking Earth Day, WPIC chief administrative officer David Badham says platinum is in the "hydrogen sweetspot" and that growth in green hydrogen through platinum is boosting progress to net-zero goals. "Platinum enables green hydrogen use through electrolysers and fuel cells and growing green hydrogen production increases future platinum demand," he says. Strong policy and commercial partnerships are accelerating hydrogen-fuelled transport, and rail transport is using hydrogen fuel cells to decarbonise. Further, there have been breakthroughs in high-power hydrogen fuel cells for the maritime sector. Similarly, platinum-based technology is helping airports and airlines transition to net zero, Badham says. "Cheaper green hydrogen is possible using platinum-based electrolysers offshore, such as to create wind-to-hydrogen plants, and platinum-based electrolysers are well suited to harnessing renewable power growth," he notes. "Platinum is helping to tackle climate change. The WPIC encourages investment in our planet and the building of healthy cities, countries and economies."
