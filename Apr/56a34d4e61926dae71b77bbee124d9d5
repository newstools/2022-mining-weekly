US-based Nevada Gold Mines (NGM) is investing in a 200 MW solar power plant to accelerate its decarbonisation programme, the Barrick-operated joint venture announced on Wednesday. Detailed engineering has started, and construction will get under way next quarter. NGM reported that Nasdaq-listed First Solar would manufacture all modules required to support the 200 MW construction entirely in the US. The modules would be delivered in the beginning of the second quarter of 2023 and would power both phases of the power plant. Commissioning of both phases will start by early 2024. NGM has committed to a 20% carbon reduction by 2025. This will be achieved through the 200 MW solar array construction and the conversion of NGM’s coal-fired power plant to cleaner burning natural gas. “The project is the latest in a series of carbon-reducing initiatives across the group’s global operations,” said Barrick group sustainability executive Grant Beringer. “The solar power plant will complement the transition of NGM’s coal power plant to a dual fuel process, which will enable it to generate electricity from natural gas, reducing carbon emissions by as much as 50%.” Barrick is targeting an overall 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 against its 2018 baseline with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050.
