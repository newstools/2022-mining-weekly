Canadian gold miner Pure Gold Mining has learned of a civil claim mentioning Pure Gold and certain other parties as defendants in the British Columbia Supreme Court. The claim alleges failures to disclose certain information relating to its operations at its mine in Red Lake, Ontario, under Canadian securities law. The plaintiff is seeking certification as a class proceeding and intends to claim damages for losses incurred in their investments in the company, notes Pure Gold. Although it is still too soon to say, Pure Gold is certain the complaint against it is unfounded and without merit. It plans to vigorously defend the claim.
