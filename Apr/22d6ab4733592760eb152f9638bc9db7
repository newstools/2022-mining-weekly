PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian government has appointed Indigenous professional services company Gee Gie to work on the first stage of a new project under the Abandoned Mines Programme. Gee Gie will work with the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety to identify, document and prioritise remediation work of abandoned mine features close to Cue, Marble Bar and Yalgoo.  Gee Gie will consult with the local shires and Aboriginal communities on the nature of the project, and work to build positive relationships within the local communities.  The project is funded through the Mining Rehabilitation Fund, a pooled fund to which Western Australian mining operators contribute.  "Western Australia has a long mining history and as a result there are abandoned mine features across the state,” Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston said. "Gee Gie and the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety will work together to prioritise the appropriate management of abandoned mine features near Cue, Marble Bar and Yalgoo.  "They will assess the risks and identify any remediation works to benefit the local communities. With Gee Gie's project capabilities and track record of working and consulting with Aboriginal and local communities, I'm confident the project will be managed respectfully."
