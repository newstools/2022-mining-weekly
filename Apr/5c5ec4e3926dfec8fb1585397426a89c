TSX-V-listed Luminex Resources has signed a binding agreement with Codelco to buy its Chalapo concessions, in Ecuador, for $60 000 and a 1% net smelter return. “Chalapo is an early stage, undrilled high sulphidation epithermal gold/silver prospect that is an exciting addition to Luminex’s southern Ecuador project portfolio,” senior VP for exploration Leo Hathaway says. The new concessions are easily accessed and proximal to the area in which Luminex already operates. The concessions are comprised of two contiguous claims and carry no required yearly investment commitment.
