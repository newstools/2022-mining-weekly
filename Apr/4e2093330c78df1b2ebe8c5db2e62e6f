PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gerhard Bond has taken the helm at dual listed gold miner OceanaGold. Bond was appointed in February as president and CEO of the gold producer, taking the reins from Scott Sullivan, who will now revert to his role as COO. “Bond’s start with OceanaGold marks a new chapter for the company. His wealth of commercial and industry experience and proven track record of driving performance and delivering on business potential will be instrumental in unlocking the company’s full value, and the board is looking forward to working with him,” said chairperson Paul Benson. Bond, for his part, said that the company’s focus would be on delivering long-term value to shareholders by safely and responsibly optimising all of its operations and maximising cash generation. “This will allow us to reduce our debt, return to paying dividends to shareholders and invest in high-return projects such as the Wharekirauponga mine in New Zealand and the Haile underground mine in the US. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us and are focused on safely delivering the full value potential of this business.”
