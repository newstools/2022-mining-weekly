PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Develop has been awarded a A$400-million mining contract at the Bellevue gold mine, in Western Australia. Over the four-year contract period, Develop’s Underground Services division would undertake construction, development and production activities at the underground mine. Commencement date for the contract is in the June quarter of 2022. Bellevue MD Steve Parsons said Develop’s team of world-class underground mining specialists were perfectly suited to the Bellevue project. “Develop has built an exceptional team with extensive underground mining knowledge and experience in Western Australia gold operations. Applying their immense experience to the Bellevue mine further derisks the project on both an operational and financial level.” “Develop has recruited a significant number of underground personnel and secured the latest equipment for use in underground construction and mining.” Develop was awarded the contract following a robust six-month competitive tender process which included rigorous analysis of the tenders by an independent third party at each stage. “This is an enormous opportunity for both companies,” said Develop MD Bill Beament. “Bellevue is an exceptional gold asset with a great production outlook and low all-in sustaining costs in the heart of Western Australia. It is one of the largest contracts in the Western Australian gold mining industry. It is also one of the most environmentally-ambitious projects, with the aim of producing Australia’s first carbon-neutral gold. “I have no doubt that applying the combined skills and experience of the Bellevue and Develop teams to this exceptional asset will ensure strong returns for all stakeholders.”
