Platinum group metals miner Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) reports that, although Hanré Rossouw had resigned as CFO with effect from April 3, he will continue to serve as a nonexecutive director. In the context of the mandatory buyout offer for all RBPlat shares, announced by Impala Platinum (Implats) in November 2021, Rossouw is precluded from resigning as a director until the mandatory offer becomes unconditional or lapses. Earlier this week, RBPlat announced that CEO Steve Phiri and COO Neil Carr would also retain their positions within the company until there is certainty about the outcome of current corporate activity.
