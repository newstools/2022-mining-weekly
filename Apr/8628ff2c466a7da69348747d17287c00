TSX-V-listed Deep-South Resources reports that the legal counsel for the Namibia Ministry of Mines and Energy has been late to file its defence affidavit and has requested an extension of ten days to file its affidavit with regard to the review of the decision of the Minister to deny the renewal of the exploration licence Haib Copper EPL 3140. The reason invoked by the Ministry’s counsel is that the Minister was out of the country since April 5, and was to return to his office only on April 25. Deep-South’s legal counsel said it would be amenable to an extension until April 29. Therefore, it is expected that the Ministry will file its defence on April 29, or at the latest on May 3. In terms of the current applicable court order, Deep-South will have until May 13 to file its reply to the defence of the Ministry.
