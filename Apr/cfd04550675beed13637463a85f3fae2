Latin American-focused Atico Mining has halted mining at its El Robe mine, in Colombia, after a landslide in the vicinity of its operations on April 1. The landslide did not result in any injuries, but minor equipment damage has been reported. It would take between two and three weeks for repairs and circuit testing, Atico said. The yearly guidance remained unchanged, and the company said it would make up list time throughout the remainder of the year.
