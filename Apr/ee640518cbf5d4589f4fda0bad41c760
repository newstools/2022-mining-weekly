PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Triple-listed gold miner SSR Mining has completed the acquisition of CSE-listed Taiga Gold Corporation. SSR in December last year announced the acquisition of all the common shares of Taiga Gold at a price of C0.265 a share, valuing the takeover target at about C$30-million. SSR said at the time that as the only gold producer in the highly prospective province of Saskatchewan, the transaction materially expanded SSR’s presence in a core jurisdiction by adding five new properties, which provide new exploration targets stretching south from the Seabee mine to SSR’s 100%-owned Amisk property. The transaction also consolidated the Fisher property, which is contiguous to the Seabee mine, eliminating a 2.5% net smelter return royalty on the property.
