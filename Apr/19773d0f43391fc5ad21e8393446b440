TSX-V- and Aim-listed Mkango Resources says exploration results at its Nkalonje Hill project continue to show potential for further mineralisation at depth, especially as it is proving similar to the high-grade Songwe Hill rare earths project. Both projects are located in Malawi. The company shares in a release that the latest assays of carbonatite dyke samples at Nkalonje have returned grades of up to 5.92% total rare earth oxides and a median grade of 2.96%. Mapping and geophysics results have confirmed that the major geological features of the project are those of an alkali silicate-carbonatite intrusive complex. Geophysical work has also identified a primary shallow drilling target beneath exposed mineralised dykes and a secondary deeper drilling target. The Nkalonje project is located about 23 km from the company’s Songwe Hill project. Based on the interpretation of recent data, Mkango has identified two drilling targets at Nkalonje, the first of which will undergo new sampling to trace the grade of the dykes along strike, and the second of which will undergo a soil sampling and trenching programme to ground truth the geophysical anomalies in the target area. Meanwhile, the company continues to progress a feasibility study on the Songwe project and plans to develo a rare earth separation plant to process the purified mixed rare earth carbonate produced at Songwe Hill.
