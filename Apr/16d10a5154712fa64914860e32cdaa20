TSX-V-listed Montage Gold is expanding its exploration focus away from the Kone deposit, in Côte d’Ivoire, as it searches for higher grade satellite feed that will boost the economics of the project. The company on Monday announced that it had been granted an exploration permit that is within haulage range of the Kone deposit. The 322km2-Sisséplé permit brings the total holdings to 983 km2, all of which is relevant to the large-scale, low-cost operation planned at Kone. Montage in February announced the results of a definitive feasibility study on the Kone project, outlining a 15-year gold project producing 3.06-million ounces with an average yearly production of 207 000 oz and a peak production of 320 000 oz.
