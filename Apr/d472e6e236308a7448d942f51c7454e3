PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Africa-focused Resolute Mining has reported a slight increase in production during the March quarter, while all-in sustaining costs have improved by 4% on the previous quarter. The ASX-listed company on Thursday reported gold production of 81 770 oz, up from the 79 816 oz produced in the December quarter, with gold sales increasing by 17%, from 75 636 oz to 88 773 oz in the same period. All-in sustaining costs for the quarter decreased by 4% on the December quarter, from $1 437/oz to $1 383/oz. Resolute told shareholders that the increased gold pour during the March quarter reflected strong production across all operations despite the major shutdown of the Syama sulphide circuit, in Mali, in February and March 2022. The performance of the sulphide circuit has improved, as anticipated following the shutdown, with higher overall plant availability and throughput achieved during the first few weeks of the current quarter. Roaster throughput has also increased since the completion of the shutdown, which included several minor modifications to the roaster and replacement of much of the refractory lining. The Syama oxide operation continued its improved performance with an 18% increase in production compared to the December quarter, while Mako, in Senegal, delivered steady production in line with expectations, despite the completion of a planned mill reline during the quarter. The Syama sulphide operation contributed 30 467 oz of gold during the quarter under review, while the oxide operation contributed 17 728 oz. The Mako operation poured a further 33 575 oz of gold.
