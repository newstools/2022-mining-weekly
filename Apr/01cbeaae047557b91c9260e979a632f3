Since acquiring a portfolio of royalties from Newcrest Mining, Aim- and TSX-V-listed Altus Strategies has generated copper and gold royalty revenues of $1.7-million (pre-tax) in the first quarter of this year. Altus currently owns 33 royalty interests, including royalties on four producing mines – the Chile-based Caserones copper mine, the Australia-based South Kalgoorlie operations and the Ballarat gold mines, and the Côte d’Ivoire-based Bonikro gold mine. Altus also has 27 project interests across nine countries and nine metals. In addition, Altus is reviewing numerous strategic royalty acquisition opportunities. CE Steven Poulton says the “exceptional” performance reflects the transformative royalty acquisitions the company has completed since August 2021, as well as the continued strong demand for copper and gold. “Our experienced technical teams are actively advancing numerous prospective gold and base metal projects across Africa as part of our high-impact ‘boots on the ground’ royalty generation strategy,” he notes. As such, Poulton says Altus’ hybrid approach, which combines royalty acquisition with organic royalty generation, differentiates it from other royalty groups and provides Altus shareholders with an enhanced blend of short-term income and long-term capital growth potential.
