Aim-listed diamond miner BlueRock Diamonds, which owns and operates the Kareevlei diamond mine, in the Kimberley region of South Africa has sold four larger gem-quality diamonds in the March tender. A 6.6 ct diamond sold for $63 000, an 8.7 ct diamond for $104 000, a 12.7 ct diamond for $128 000 and a 19.3 ct diamond for $116 000. "It is very pleasing to announce the recovery of another four high-value diamonds, which were sold in our latest tender. The market is obviously being influenced by the current geopolitical situation and this is partially reflected in our latest average tender price. However, the overall supply side of rough diamonds has been tight for some time and is very likely to remain so for the foreseeable future; we therefore anticipate strong ongoing demand for the high-quality Kareevlei parcel of diamonds. "Following our successful fundraising of last week, management are focused on ramping up our new processing plant, which will see production almost double to 36 000 ct to 43 000 ct. 2022 will be a transformational year and we look forward to the road ahead amid positive market fundamentals," chairperson Mike Houston comments. .
