TSX-V-listed exploration and development company Nevada Zinc has appointed director Igor Danyliuk as president and CEO with effect from June 1, replacing Max Vichniakov, who has also stepped down as a member of the board of directors. Danyliuk brings more than 30 years of capital markets experience having worked in Canada and the US as an investment banker, a top ranked equity research analyst, and most recently as head of research for one of Canada's major banks. He also has engineering experience having worked in the US as a technical service engineer for a major US resin manufacturer. “My primary focus at this time is the completion of the final stage of our multiphase pilot programme being conducted by Hazen Research. This work is designed to produce commercial grade zinc sulphate and to provide us with operating and capital costs for the production process. I want to thank Max for his contributions to Nevada Zinc and wish him all the best in his future endeavours,” said Danyliuk. The company also announced that Michael Wilson had joined Nevada Zinc as a technical adviser. Wilson was president and CEO of Behre Dolbear Canada and has more than 40 years of experience in the fields of geology, mineralogy and mining engineering of surface and underground mines. Wilson has been responsible for the design, planning and cost determination of mining operations in multiple jurisdictions involving a variety of mineral commodities and will be instrumental in assisting in the advancement of the company’s zinc sulphate initiative. Nevada Zinc focuses on its wholly-owned Lone Mountain zinc project in central Nevada, with the strategic objective of producing zinc-based products including fertilisers, animal feed and chemicals.
