Canada-based lithium developer Cypress Development on Monday reported that it had secured an extension of time to prevent forfeiture of its water permit in the Clayton Valley of Nevada, after a court dismissed a petition for a judicial review. The company acquired water right permit 44411 from Intor Resources, a subsidiary of Nevada Sunrise Gold, for use at its Clayton Valley lithium project. Intor submitted an application for extension of time to prevent forfeiture of the permit in July last year. The state engineer approved the extension in November, but a petition was lodged. With the court order, the state engineer's approval is final and binding, and the extension is valid until August 28, 2022. The permit allows for the appropriation of the public waters of the state of Nevada in the amount of 1 770 acre-feet of groundwater a year for mining, milling and domestic use.  This amount represents the biggest-single volume of permitted water available in the Clayton Valley, which is a fully appropriated hydrogeographic basin.
