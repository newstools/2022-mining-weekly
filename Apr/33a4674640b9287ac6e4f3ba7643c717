Entries for South Africa’s yearly platinum jewellery design and manufacturing competition, PlatAfrica, are now open. The theme of the twenty-third edition of PlatAfrica is ‘#Hope’, calling for designs that demonstrate trust in an uncertain world. Hosted yearly by Anglo American Platinum, Metal Concentrators and Platinum Guild International (PGI) India, PlatAfrica aims to increase local beneficiation and position platinum as the jewellery metal of choice for discerning consumers. “This year’s theme is inspired by the world’s Covid-19 experience and the embrace of sustainability and meaningful luxury. Designers are required to interpret the #Hope theme through specific design hooks that speak to new perspectives, transitions and interconnectedness. “Judges will be looking for creativity, originality and interpretation of the #Hope theme in delivery of design expectations, along with an assessment of technical excellence,” says PGI India business director Pallavi Sharma. The competition features three prize categories – professionals, apprentices and students and the People’s Choice award, where the public will have the opportunity to vote for their favourite jewellery piece. In addition to prize money, winners stand the chance to be considered for participation in PGI India’s design sourcing process this year. Metal requests for entry must be received before June 1, and participants must submit their final design pieces by July 29.
