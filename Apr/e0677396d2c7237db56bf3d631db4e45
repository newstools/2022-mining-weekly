PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Tietto is on track to start mining at its Abujar gold project in Côte d’Ivoire, in August, after appointing contractor EPSA Internacional SA (EPSA) as preferred tenderer for the openpit mining contract. “The openpit mining contract is the largest operational contract for our Abujar gold project, and the appointment of EPSA as preferred tenderer follows the completion of a competitive tender and due diligence process examining safety, experience, and operational capabilities,” Tietto MD Dr Caigen Wang said. “We are very pleased to appoint EPSA as preferred tenderer for the openpit mining contract as the company has a strong track record in the region including operating experience in Côte d’Ivoire at Perseus’s Yaouré gold mine which is located 150 km to the east of Abujar. “Abujar is an exciting and robust gold project expected to deliver life-of-mine revenue of more than $3.2-billion, and has expanding exploration upside and strong potential for resource expansion, with an aggressive drilling programme underway,” said Wang. “Tietto has an experienced team on board to deliver the project on time and on budget and we look forward to working with EPSA as we track towards first gold later this year and forecast gold production of 260 000 oz at all-in sustaining cost of A$651/oz in 2023.”
