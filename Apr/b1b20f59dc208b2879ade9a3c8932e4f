PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Firefinch is expecting gold production at its Morila gold mine, in Mali, to increase in the second half of 2022, as ore mining from the Morila Super Pit started. The ASX-listed company on Tuesday reported that gold production in the first quarter of 2022 reached 10 874 oz, which was consistent with the guidance of between 10 000 oz and 15 000 oz of gold. However, the miner noted that production was now benefiting from the start of mining at the N’Tiola deposit, which started six weeks ahead of schedule. “Our first quarter 2022 gold production of 10 874 oz comfortably met guidance and pleasingly was delivered injury-free. We are on the brink of benefitting from the mining of the Morila Super Pit and N’Tiola, both of which have commenced ahead of schedule,” said MD Dr Michael Anderson. “We are confident to maintain our 2022 production guidance for Morila at 100 000 oz of gold and it is exciting to look forward to annualised production rates in the second half of 2022 in excess of 140 000 oz. We are also refreshing the life-of-mine plan and intensifying drilling as we seek to fully test the potential of Morila and its satellite ore bodies.” For the second quarter, Morila has a production target of between 17 000 oz and 20 000 oz, which will increase to between 30 000 oz and 35 000 oz in the third quarter, and to between 36 000 oz and 40 000 oz in the fourth quarter.
