Caledonia Mining’s Blanket mine, in Zimbabwe, produced 18 515 oz in the first quarter of this year – a record for any first quarter and up 40% from the 13 197 oz produced in the first quarter of 2021. For the full-year, the miner expects to produce between 73 000 oz and 80 000 oz of gold. CEO Steve Curtis says the 18 515 oz is ahead of Caledonia’s expectations and reflects the increased capacity at Central Shaft. “The ramp-up in production towards our quarterly target of 20 000 oz means that we are on track to meet our annual production target.” However, he says a fatality occurred during the first quarter. “We always take the safety of our employees very seriously and I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the deceased.”
