A series of mining companies have, this year, joined the ranks of Brand Finance South Africa 100 for the first time. Every year, Brand Finance puts 5 000 of the biggest brands to the test and ranks them across all sectors and countries. South Africa’s top 100 most valuable and strongest brands are included in a dedicated national ranking. Brand Finance has recognised the booming demand for commodities and decided to reflect the significant and increasing importance of several mining brands in the Brand Finance South Africa 100 ranking for 2022. The largest new entrant is the twenty-third most valuable South African brand – Northam Platinum – with a brand value of R8.1-billion. Northam is followed by Anglo American Platinum, with a brand value of R5-billion, in thirty-fourth place. Following closely behind, ranked thirty-sixth, is Impala Platinum, with its R4.7-billion brand value. Coming in at thirty-ninth on the rankings is newly ranked AngloGold Ashanti, with a brand value of R4.1-billion, immediately ahead of Kumba Iron Ore and its brand value of R3.9-billion. Gold Fields has settled in fortieth place, at a brand value of R3.2-billion. Brand Finance explains that brand value is understood as the net economic benefit that a brand owner would achieve by licensing the brand in the open market. Brand strength is the efficacy of a brand’s performance on intangible measures relative to its competitors. Meanwhile, telecommunications company MTN, with a brand value of R59.8-billion, has retained the number one place on the ranking of the most valuable South African brands in the world. Retailer Checkers is the fastest-growing brand in the South Africa 100 ranking. Its brand value increased by 71% year-on-year to R11.1-billion.
