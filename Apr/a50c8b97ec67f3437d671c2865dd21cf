Aim-listed AfriTin Mining has released its five-year growth strategy, which includes enlarging its footprint in Namibia through existing operations and new mining locations. The company also plans on developing multiple technology metals concentrates, with plans to produce lithium, tantalum and tungsten alongside tin. AfriTin will ramp up its tin concentrate production to 2 800 t/y at the Uis mine, while targets for lithium and tantalum concentrate production have been set at 60 000 t/y and 45 t/y, respectively. The company aims to expand its existing tin mineral resource from 71-million tonnes to 200-million tonnes, containing tin, lithium and tantalum. Exploration is already under way in this regard, both within a near radius of the current processing plant and on a mining licence located 107 km from the Uis mine, at a deposit called Brandberg West. CEO Anthony Viljoen says the company proudly publishes this ambition and pathway to becoming a producer of multiple technology metals over the next five years. “AfriTin has proven it is already part of a small and unique group of global tin producers. “What enhances our ambitions and the achievable future strategy is the underexplored lithium potential, combined with multiple historic openpit tin mines close to our Uis mine. We look forward to bringing these exciting deposits into production and leveraging the knowledge gained from successfully building a new mine at Uis.”
