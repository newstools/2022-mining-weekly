The Presidency on April 29 received the fourth part of the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture.
 
Secretary of the Commission Professor Itumeleng Mosala handed over the report to acting Director-General in The Presidency Thami Ngwenya at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
 
Part four of the report comprises four volumes, with the first dealing with the attempted capture of the National Treasury; EOH Holdings and the City of Johannesburg; and Alexkor. The second volume deals with the Free State asbestos project debacle and the Free State R1-billion housing project debacle. The third and fourth volumes deal with the capture of electricity utility Eskom.
 
The first part of the report was handed over to President Cyril Ramaphosa by the Commission Chairperson, Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, in January. This was followed by the handover of the second and third reports in February and March, respectively.
