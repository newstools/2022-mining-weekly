LIMA – The Peruvian government on Wednesday declared a state of emergency near MMG's Las Bambas copper mine, where production has been halted for a week due to indigenous communities camped inside. A state of emergency suspends civil liberties such as the right to assembly and protest. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Las Bambas was weighing attempting to evict protesters on Wednesday.
