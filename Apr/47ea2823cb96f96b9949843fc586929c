Canada-based Kinross Gold Corporation plans to declare an initial inferred mineral resource on its Great Bear project, in Ontario, in coming weeks. The company also plans to start work on a prefeasibility study on the project, which it acquired in February. Kinross will complete 200 000 m of drilling using ten drill rigs this year, focusing on the LP Fault Zone, which is the most significant discovery, to date, at Great Bear. To prepare for the PFS, Kinross will undertake field work including metallurgy, hydrology and geotechnical drilling and testwork, as well as permitting baseline studies. Kinross is budgeting $60-million for project activities this year. Drilling conducted in 2021 returned assay results on the LP Fault Zone including 10 m of gold grading 15.1 g/t from 461 m, and 11 m of gold grading 10.8 g/t from 18 m. Since closing the acquisition, the company has hit the ground running at the project, says Kinross president and CEO Paul Rollinson, adding that it helps realise the company’s vision of a large, long-life mining complex at Red Lake in Ontario.
