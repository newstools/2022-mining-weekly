PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Ramelius Resources has reported a slight drop in production during the three months to March, as labour shortages in Western Australia hit a peak in January and February. The miner reported that gold production in the March quarter reached 58 602 oz, at an all-in sustaining cost of A41 596/oz, down from the 66 919 oz produced in the December quarter, at an all-in sustaining cost of A$1 493/oz. The Mt Magnet operation contributed 29 588 oz to the gold production, with Edna May contributing a further 29 014 oz. Gold sales in the March quarter reached 51 423 oz, at an achieved gold price of A$2 405/oz. Ramelius told shareholders that the lower production resulted from the lower road haulage tonnes through January and February this year, as labour shortages took its toll. However, the company was anticipating a return to levels of road haul activity in the June quarter, with production in the full year expected to be at the lower end of the guidance of between 260 000 oz and 265 000 oz. For the June quarter, Ramelius is targeting a production of between 69 000 oz and 74 000 oz of gold, at an all-in sustaining cost of some A$1 525/oz.
