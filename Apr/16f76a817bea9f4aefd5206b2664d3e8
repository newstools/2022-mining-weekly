PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining on Tuesday reported that COO Terry Holohan has been appointed as company CEO, following the resignation of Stuart Gale as MD and CEO. Holohan will formally take over as CEO after Gale leaves the company, in order to pursue an opportunity in the Australia-focused resources sector. Holohan, who has more than 40 years of experience in the mining industry, was appointed a COO at Resolute in May of last year, and has since been responsible for all aspects of the company’s operations and projects. “Strengthening our senior leadership team has been a strategic focus at Resolute, and this attention to succession planning will allow us to manage the current transition with minimal disruption to the business. We are fortunate to have someone of Terry’s calibre and extensive experience already in the company to assume the CEO role,” said chairperson Martin Botha.
