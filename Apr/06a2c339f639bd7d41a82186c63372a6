PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Uranium developer Boss Energy on Monday announced that it would close its A$5-million share purchase plan (SPP) early, after receiving applications well in excess of the raising target. Boss recently announced a A$125-million equity raise to fund the construction of the Honeymoon uranium project, in South Australia. The company has already completed the book-build for its A$120-million two-tranche share placement. The first tranche will consist of 43-million shares, and will raise A$92-million under the company’s existing placement capacity, while the second tranche of a further 13-million shares, raising a further A$28-million, will be subject to shareholder approval. The SPP, which allowed shareholders to subscribe for A$20 000 worth of additional shares in the company, priced at A$2.15 each, will close on April 4, and SPP shares are expected to be issued on April 8.
