JSE-listed diversified miner Exxaro Resources has used the occasion of its annual Sustainability Summit on April 7 to reiterate its commitment to being a leading sustainable and responsible mining company. The theme of this year’s summit was the Power of 5, marking five years of fatality-free operations as of March 2. Incoming CEO Dr Nombasa Tsengwa said the achievement was a result of numerous initiatives undertaken by Exxaro, including the Khetha Ukuphepha Campaign. The safety campaign was launched across all of the company’s business units in 2019 to address the risky nature of mining work. On April 5, Exxaro received the Fatality Free Business Coal Safe Award for the second consecutive year, which is further testament to the company’s safety efforts towards employees, host communities and the mining industry. Tsengwa urged the company’s partners and stakeholders to work together in ensuring at least another five years of no fatalities. Other commendable achievements by Exxaro include being ranked number one for environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance-selected resources company metrics, in terms of the Financial Times Stock Exchange Russell Index; and being ranked among Moody’s ESG Solutions’ Best Emerging Market Performers. Exxaro won the Best Sustainability Reporting Award in the Metals & Mining category in the 2021 ESG Reporting Awards. The company was also announced as the Best Sustainable Mining Leadership award winner by reporting and analysis agency Capital Finance International.
