Diversified miner Teck Resources has announced a carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) pilot project at its Trail Operations metallurgical complex in southern British Columbia. The CCUS pilot is expected to begin operation in the second half of 2023. The CCUS pilot supports Teck’s net-zero climate change strategy, including a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of its operations by 33% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. “This carbon capture pilot is an important step towards our knowledge building for the application of carbon capture, utilisation and storage as an emissions reduction solution, as we work to evaluate pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and achieve our net-zero goal,” said president and CEO Don Lindsay. “The pilot also provides us with a technical platform to assist our steelmaking coal customers in materially reducing the carbon intensity of their steel production.” The pilot plant will capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the acid plant flue gas at Trail at a rate of 3 t/d. The pilot project will also evaluate options for the utilisation and/or storage of the captured CO2 at Trail. If successful, the project could be scaled up to an industrial CCUS plant with the potential to capture over 100 000 t/y of CO2 at Trail.
