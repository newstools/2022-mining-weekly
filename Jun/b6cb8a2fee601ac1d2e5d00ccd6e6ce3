ASX-listed exploration company Resource Mining Corporation has started a maiden drilling programme for 18 reverse circulation holes at the Kabulwanyele nickel project, in Tanzania. The 1 000 m drill programme is testing a 2 km strike anomaly that was identified from prior soil and rock sampling work, and should assist the company in understanding the genetic model for mineralisation. The sampling programme returned soil samples grading up to 0.85% nickel and rock samples reporting up to 1.27% nickel. “After spending some time on the ground over the past few months, we are convinced that Kabulwanyele has all the right geological ingredients for significant nickel mineralisation,” says executive chairperson Asimwe Kabunga.
