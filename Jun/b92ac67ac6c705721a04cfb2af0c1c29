Gold miner Harmony Gold says an employee has died following an engineering-related incident at its Kusasalethu mine, near Carletonville, on June 6. “Our heartfelt condolences go out to those impacted by this loss of life. We are deeply saddened and very concerned by the frequency of incidents, particularly at this mine – it is unacceptable. "A safety day was held at Kusasalethu today, where everyone – including the unions – reinforced safety messages and emphasised the importance of our safety and accountability values. "Our priority at this stage is to support the families, colleagues and friends impacted by this tragedy and to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the reason for yet another incident,” says Harmony CEO Peter Steenkamp. The relevant authorities have been informed and an investigation into the incident is currently under way, the gold miner reports.
