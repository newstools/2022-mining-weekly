PERTH (miningweekly.com) -  Diamond miner Burgundy Diamond Mines has unveiled its ‘ultra-luxury’ diamond brand Maison Mazerea, aimed at cutting and polishing natural fancy colour diamonds. The ASX-listed company said that Maison Mazerea was the final key part of Burgundy’s strategy to become an end-to-end diamond company, with a vertically integrated model of mining and buying rough stones, conducting its own cutting and polishing, and selling through the retail brand in profit-sharing agreements with design jewellers. “We have been working towards this exciting launch of Maison Mazerea for some time. This is the final piece of the strategy jigsaw that will see us become a true end-to-end diamond company,” said MD Peter Ravenscroft. “We now have the ability to source rough fancy colour diamonds, have them cut and polished in our own facilities and see them showcased in unique jewellery pieces by some of the world’s leading jewellers. As we move rapidly to jewellery sales through our collaborative alliances, our shareholders will start to share in the greater margins generated throughout the value chain.” The fancy colour natural diamonds produced by Maison Mazerea will be characterised by unique heritage cuts, Burgundy said.
