PERTH (miningweekly.com) – An insurgent attack at a mine project in the Cabo Delgado province, in Mozambique, has seen ASX-listed miners operating in the region scramble to assure shareholders. The insurgent attack happened at a mine project near Ancuabe, some 200 km from ASX-listed Syrah Resources’ Balama project, as well as from fellow-listed Battery Minerals’ own Balama project, and some 130 km from its Montepuez project. Syrah told shareholders on Thursday that this latest incident, along with another in the same area in recent days, was the first confirmed attack in the district of Ancuabe. The company said that prior to these, there had been a significant improvement in the overall security situation in Cabo Delgado. Syrah has now suspended all personnel and logistics movement through areas affected by the attack, but told shareholders that mining and processing operations at its graphite project have not been impacted. The company is also in contact with the government, security authorities and other stakeholders to monitor the situation and assess the safe resumption of transport operations. Battery Minerals, for its part, told shareholders that its own operations were not impacted by the event, and that it also remained in contact with stakeholders to assess the situation. Furthermore, the company said that in its opinion, the attack posed no threat to its A$12.5-million deal with London-listed Tirupati Graphite to sell its Mozambique assets. The deal was struck in August of last year and would see Battery Minerals divest of the projects in exchange for A$1.5-million in cash and A$11-million in Tirupati shares. Meanwhile, ASX-listed Triton Minerals, which is developing its Ancuabe graphite project, in Cabo Delgado, went into a trading halt on Thursday. The company has not given any update on its own operations in Mozambique.
