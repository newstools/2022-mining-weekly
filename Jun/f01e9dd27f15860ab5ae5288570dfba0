TSX-V-listed American Lithium has validated sulphate of potash (SoP) as a byproduct of future lithium production at the Falchani project, in Peru. COO Laurence Stefan says the strategic importance of producing significant amounts of SoP from Falchani cannot be overstated, noting that it has the potential to make Peru self-sufficient for SoP fertilisers. “This byproduct will not only provide an additional potential revenue stream at Falchani, but more importantly will also provide a major source of domestic SoP for Peru with the potential to largely reduce the country’s dependence on imported overseas fertilisers,” he says. Recent shortages of fertilisers in Peru have seen SoP imports rising to more than 60 000 t/y. Testing was completed at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) laboratories in Sydney, Australia. The SoP produced by ANSTO from Falchani mineralisation is 45% potassium and 20% sulphur. The current test programme at ANSTO builds on previous programmes, which have demonstrated the ability to produce battery grade lithium carbonate from the Falchani mineralisation. The latest programme has pursued to modify the baseline flowsheet to allow the recovery of SoP, and cesium and rubidium byproducts.
