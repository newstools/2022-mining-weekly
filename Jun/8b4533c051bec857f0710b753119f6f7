West Africa-focused miner Nimba Development Company (NDC) has started with a preliminary technical information exchange process with the government of Guinea, as part of the Nimba iron-ore mine’s development. Particularly, NDC has shared with the Guinean Ministry of Mines and Geology its high-level plans, prepared in conjunction with NDC’s technical partners, which include DRA Senet, Vecturis and Sea Invest. DRA Senet will manage the preparation of a ten-million-tonne-a-year bankable feasibility study (BFS), while Vecturis has already carried out initial studies for the railway link to existing infrastructure in Liberia. Sea Invest will work on the development and configuration of a new port in Buchanan, Liberia. NDC plans on completing the BFS within six to seven months once the company lists on the LSE, which is planned for the fourth quarter of this year. Guinean Mines and Geology Minister Moussa Magassouba comments that different sections of industry can all work together with government in a spirit of cooperation for the greater good. “I see an impressive collective effort from local people in the Nimba region and across our country to help make Guinea a prosperous major global centre for iron-ore production and am eager for the work to start.” NDC CEO Steven Din adds that the development of the Nimba mine will catalyse the creation of a new iron-ore province in West Africa and support enhanced trade and economic prosperity in the region.
