The Toronto Stock Exchange has announced the launch of a new battery metals index, which will measure the performance of TSX- and TSX-V-listed companies that are focused on the production of and exploration for metals involved in the decarbonisation of the transportation sector. "In keeping with our long history of supporting the growth of the critical minerals industry and the interrelationship with clean technologies, decarbonisation, renewable energy and vehicle electrification, we are pleased to announce the launch of the new S&P/TSX Battery Metals Index," said Toronto Stock Exchange CEO and global head of capital formation Loui Anastasopoulos. "Global demand for battery metals continues to gain momentum and the goal of this new benchmark is to provide investors increased exposure to, and deeper insights into, the cleantech and energy transition story. "Toronto Stock Exchange remains focused on the future, committed to working with our clients and industry stakeholders to seek innovative ways to enable the success of traditional and newly-defined sectors across our diverse and ever-evolving public markets ecosystem." The S&P/TSX Battery Metals Index tracks Canada-listed companies engaged in the production of or exploration for metals used in battery manufacturing. In 2021, companies focused on critical and battery minerals accounted for more than 25% of the total equity capital raised by the mining sector on TSX and TSX-V.
