UK mining company Anglesey Mining said on Wednesday that its deputy chairperson William (Bill) Hooley had passed away. "We are deeply saddened to hear of the untimely passing of our colleague and friend Bill Hooley. Bill was instrumental to the advancement of Anglesey and its Parys Mountain mine project during his time as CEO between 2006 and 2021, and subsequently continued to provide valued advice and experience to the company and the board as deputy chairman,” said chairperson John Kearney. Hooley was also a director of Anglesey associate company, Labrador Iron Mines (LIM) since 2007, serving as president and COO from 2007 to 2011, during which time he directed the initial development and successful construction, into commercial production, of LIM's James iron-ore mine in Labrador, Canada. He had over 50 years of experience in minerals operations and management in a long and successful career with mining and service companies throughout the world, including extensive experience in Australia, Canada and the UK. Previously, Hooley was MD of Micon International from 2000 to 2005. In addition, he held various management and executive posts with mining and service companies in the UK and Australia from 1975 to 1999. "His wise counsel, friendship, dry humour, and loyalty will be sadly missed", added Kearney. "We send our sincere condolences to Bill's wife, daughter and family."
