PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mineral sands miner Base Resources has resumed operations at its Kwale operations, in Kenya. The company earlier this month reported that heavy rainstorms had caused flash flooding in the area, which had overwhelmed the project’s dewatering system. The ASX- and Aim-listed company on Wednesday said that mining at Kwale had progressively returned to normal over the past week, and a series of mitigations were being implemented to reduce the likelihood of a future reoccurrence, including construction of additional stormwater diversion bunds and the acquisition of supplementary high capacity diesel dewatering pumps. Base confirmed that it remained on schedule to achieve financial year 2022 production guidance.
