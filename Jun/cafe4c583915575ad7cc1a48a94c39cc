US-based SSR Mining has temporarily suspended operations at its Çöpler mine, in Turkey, following a cyanide spill last week. Çöpler was visited by a delegation from the Turkey Environment Ministry on Tuesday afternoon – the second such visit in response to the leak of leach solution containing about 8 kg of diluted cyanide at the site on June 21. SSR said that the Ministry on Tuesday afternoon provided initial verbal guidance on expected improvement initiatives required at the Çöpler mine heap leach pad, which would be followed with a written notice in the coming days. During the implementation of these initiatives, the Çöpler operations would remain temporarily suspended. “SSR Mining expects to implement these initiatives in a timely fashion and bring the Çöpler operation back to full capacity in the coming weeks once Ministry of Environment officials are satisfied with the implementation,” the TSX- and ASX-listed company stated.
