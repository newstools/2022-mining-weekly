Striking employees of Russian aluminium giant Rusal's Guinea subsidiary Compagnie des Bauxites de Dian-Dian (COBAD) returned to work on June 2, one week after their protest action started, a union leader said on Monday. The workers at COBAD went on strike on May 26 to demand better pay and conditions. "We obtained a 5% increase on our base salary, housing allowance and guarantees for medical treatment," union leader Yamoussa Bangoura told Reuters. Rusal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Guinea is the world's second-largest producer of bauxite, an ore used to make aluminium, and a key supplier of bauxite to China. It produced 83-million tonnes of bauxite in 2021, Guinea's mines ministry statistics showed. COBAD produced 3.59-million tonnes of bauxite last year, while Rusal's other Guinea operation, Compagnie des Bauxites de Kindia, produced 2.65-million tonnes, according to the mines ministry.
