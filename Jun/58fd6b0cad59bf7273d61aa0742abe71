Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo has welcomed the appointment of Jacob Mbele as director-general of the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE), saying he believes Mbele’s illustrious career at the DMRE qualifies him for the position. Mbele has served as the chief director for electricity in the former Department of Energy and later became deputy director-general for energy programmes and projects at the DMRE. Mbele holds a Master’s in Business Administration, Post Graduate Diploma in Engineering (industrial) and Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Electrical). “We believe that, with the minerals and energy sector currently facing challenges, including high fuel prices, constrained energy supply and a low ranking as mining destination by the Fraser Institute’s annual survey, Mr Mbhele (sic) is the right man to steer the ship in the right direction,” says Luzipo. "We are confident that with his academic qualifications and expertise in areas of policy development, energy planning, and programme management, Mr Mbele will steer the department to becoming a leader in the transformation of South Africa’s economic growth agenda through the sustainable development of the mining and energy sectors," the DMRE says in a statement. Luzipo says the committee looks forward to working with Mbele and the DMRE management team. He also wishes former director-general Advocate Thabo Mokoena well in his future endeavours.
