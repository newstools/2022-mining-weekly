The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) claims it has served three contractors supplying services to platinum group metals miner Impala Platinum (Implats) with notice to embark on an “indefinite” strike, starting on June 20. On June 21, Numsa says, its members will gather to strike near Shaft No 8 in Freedom Park, Rustenburg. The 4 000 Numsa members associated with the strike are contract workers and the union says these contractors are “exploiting” workers by paying them a “fraction of what their permanent colleagues earn, for doing exactly the same job”. In particular, Numsa says the management of two of the companies refuse to bargain with it. Numsa says it has submitted wage demands, but that these contractors do not want to engage with the union. Numsa says it is a recognised union with the third contractor but that Implats’ management is refusing to grant the union access to the workplace or to enable Numsa to represent members or hold meetings there.
