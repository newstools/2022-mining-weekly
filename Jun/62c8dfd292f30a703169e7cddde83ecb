The new generation of manufacturer MLT Group’s Super-Screw range allows for a reduction in conveyor downtime, while also improving productivity, the company says, noting that it is “an optimal way to splice conveyor belts”. In order to meet the needs of all its customers, the permanent endless system has proven its worth all over the world by offering a simple and quick installation in any situation, the company says, adding that it allows customers to “discover a wide range of simple and fast splicing systems that meet all needs, constraints and requirements”. In the same range, the premium Super-Screw is the company’s flexible screw splice to screw in polyurethane, which comprises the upper part of the new Super-Screw splice and provides a considerable gain in abrasion resistance (up to 15 mm3), while maintaining the flexibility, perfect integration and strength of Super-Screw. In terms of security, and to optimise maintenance and conveyor downtime, MLT Group has revolutionised the world of splicing with Super-Screw Security, which allows users to predict and anticipate the time to change a splice, further offering users a considerable reduction in downtime. In order to always improve innovation, MLT’s research and development teams have gone beyond the limits of the Super-Screw Original to create a brand-new generation of flexible screw splices, which are even more flexible and resistant, and housed under the “Super-Screw Evolution” banner. The manufacturer’s teams created and developed the “Super-Screw” range in 1994, making it the world’s first flexible screw splice.
