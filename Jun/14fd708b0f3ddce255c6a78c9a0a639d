With the growing requirement to do more with less, contractors can now take advantage of industrial machinery company Metso Outotec’s Lokotrack ST2.3 scalping screen, the versatility of which enables contractors to adapt the machine and deliver their desired results on a variety of applications. This is particularly beneficial, as contractors can cost-effectively transfer productivity from one job site to the next, despite the change in operating conditions, through transporting the machine without requiring a permit. The machine’s fuel economy also helps fleet owners reduce their operating costs. The machine has a 260 ℓ tank and uses about 8 ℓ/h of fuel while in use, crushing, screening and materials handling equipment supplier Pilot Crushtec sales and marketing director Francois Marais said when introducing the machine to media on June 9. Newly launched in South Africa, and now available from Pilot Crushtec, the Lokotrack ST2.3 is a multi-use scalping screen that can be deployed in several applications and process various feed materials. Particularly suited for heavy-duty scalping, fine screening and recycling, the machine is designed to process a range of materials, from topsoil and recycled concrete waste, to road base material and fine aggregates. The machine can be used as a standalone unit or as part of a multi-stage crushing and screening process. Its versatility is enhanced by the various screen media options, including grizzly, punch plate, finger grizzly and wire mesh. Despite its compact build, the machine has a 4.6 m² screening area, making it the widest in its class. This is complemented by a stroke up to 13 mm with 5G (G-force) acceleration, resulting in a high screening performance.
