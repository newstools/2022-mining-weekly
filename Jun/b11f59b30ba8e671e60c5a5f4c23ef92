Aim-listed Kefi Gold and Copper says media in Ethiopia have inaccurately reported that it had lost its Tulu Kapi licence. It notes that it has received a reminder of deadline letter from the Ethiopia Minister of Mines referring to a new deadline of June 30, by which it is required to demonstrate the availability of project funding and to check compliance with regard to the environment, duties and taxes, land rent and exploration reports. "The company remains confident of its compliance with all regulatory requirements and also remains confident in its ability to achieve its plan as set out in its announcement dated June 15, including the signing of the umbrella funding agreement by the end of June, which will demonstrate the full funding and any attaching remaining conditions."
