PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Resources & Energy Group (REZ) has concluded mining operations at Granny Venn, in Western Australia. The company last week told shareholders that toll milling for the project’s fourth and final production campaign had been completed with 126 000 t of ore processed at an estimated head grade of 2.37 g/t gold for 9 592 oz of gold. “This is a great result, and full credit to our team and our mining partners BM Mining Services, the production statistics speak for themselves. Since our acquisition, the company has rapidly moved to commercialise this near-term production opportunity,” said REZ director Daniel Moore. The free cash flow generated from Granny Venn is expected to underpin exploration efforts going forward across the broader East Menzies goldfield project area. REZ told shareholders that preparations were already under way for exploration drilling over the highly prospective Gigante Grande gold project.
