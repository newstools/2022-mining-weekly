The Stillwater mine, in Montana, will remain suspended for four to six weeks to allow for access to the mine to be restored following recent flooding, precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater reported on Friday. The Stillwater mine accounts for about 60% of mined production from the group's US platinum-group metals (PGM) operations. The June 13 floods in Montana affected a widespread region surrounding Sibanye-Stillwater’s mines. The company’s mining and metallurgical operations were largely unaffected, but several bridges and roads in the vicinity of the Stillwater mine had been damaged, restricting access to the mine and requiring rerouting of water, tailings and other piping. Remediation work on the east/west access bridge within the Stillwater mine complex has begun and should be completed in about four weeks, Sibanye said. Access to the East Boulder mine and Columbus metallurgical facilities remains intact and both facilities continued operating during the flooding events. “We have been encouraged by the positive response to the flooding by the entire community and are proud of the key role our employees have played in supporting those worst affected during this difficult period. We will continue to work with the local authorities and other stakeholders to fast-track the recovery of the region and look forward to resuming operations at the Stillwater section in due course,” said CEO Neal Froneman.
