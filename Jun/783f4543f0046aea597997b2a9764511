The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has expressed shock over a health and safety incident at African Rainbow Minerals’ (ARM's) Modikwa platinum mine, in Limpopo, and has urged the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to investigate the incident. The union reports that, on June 10, two employees working for a development contractor for the mine were injured when they were travelling underground. The NUM says a wheel meant to be fitted on a load haul dump machine struck the female employees and caused severe injury. The union says one employee was killed instantly, while the other died later in hospital. ARM, however, says there was only one fatality.
