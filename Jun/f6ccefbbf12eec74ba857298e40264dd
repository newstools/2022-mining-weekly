Gold miner Harmony Gold Mining Company has obtained key regulatory approvals for its Kareerand expansion project, enabling it to continue with the retreatment of surface deposits at Mine Waste Solutions (MWS). Harmony acquired the MWS reclamation operation, near Stilfontein, in North West, in October 2020. MWS treats 2.2-million tonnes a month from historical tailings facilities. Residue is then deposited on the existing Kareerand tailings storage facility, which is running out of tailings deposition capacity and requires an extended tailings dam – the Kareerand expansion project. The project is expected to produce about 100 000 oz/y of gold and add 16 years of mine life to the operation. This lowers the risk profile of Harmony’s asset portfolio and improves its margins as a result. “The Kareerand expansion project is another example of ‘mining with purpose’. This low-risk, low-cost operation will ensure healthy returns for investors, the creation of jobs for another 16 years and the rehabilitation and restoration of land in the area,” says Harmony CEO Peter Steenkamp.
