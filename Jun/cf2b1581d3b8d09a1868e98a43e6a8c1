Development work at the Rincon lithium project, in Argentina, is about 90% complete, keeping the 2 000-t/y lithium carbonate operation on track for first production in the third quarter of this year. Argosy Minerals’ MD Zerko Zuvela says that the company’s operations team is getting closer to completing construction works and progressing with plant commissioning works. The project is set to be commissioned in a strong lithium market, which should result in robust product sales revenues, he says. Zuvela notes that lithium carbonate prices are forecast to continue around record highs during 2022 and 2023. “The company is very excited with our progress to become the next commercial-scale lithium carbonate production operation, transforming into a cashflow generator, and progressing toward the next stage, 12 000-t/y-scale operations,” he says.
