US-based SSR Mining’s stock fell on Monday as the company reported a cyanide leak at its Çöpler mine, in Turkey, which may result in a temporary suspension of operations. SSR, which is listed on the Nasdaq, TSX and ASX, said local Turkish media and social media posts from the Environment Ministry indicated that it would be ordered to halt operations. The company is seeking a formal response from the government. SSR explained that it had experienced a minor leak, estimated at 8 kg of cyanide within diluted solution from a pipeline that pumps solutions to the heap leach pad. The leak was within the mine operating area and was cleaned up immediately, without any environment impact or discharge from the site, the miner stated. SRR has notified the relevant authorities of the event. The company’s stock traded nearly 5% down on the Nasdaq and TSX on Monday and also fell on the ASX on Tuesday.
