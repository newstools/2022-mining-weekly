Aim-listed Oriole Resources has provided an exploration update on its 90%-owned Bibemi gold project in Cameroon, with the first two holes of the ongoing Phase 4 diamond drilling programme confirming the existence of mineralised sub-horizontal quartz veins between the previously defined subvertical shear veins. Confirmation of these sub-horizontal veins could be important for building a volume of mineralised material at Bakassi Zone 1, one of four prospects at the project, the company says. Oriole is working towards delivery of a Join Ore Reserves Committee-classified exploration target at Bakassi Zone 1. “The successful intersection of sub-horizontal extensional veins at Bakassi Zone 1, in addition to the already defined subvertical northeast-trending shear veins, continues to support the team’s technical assessment of the system. “This extensional event appears to have created opportunities for the injection of mineralising fluids, which may in turn (subject to positive assay results) lead to a significant volumetric increase in the known mineralisation in Zone 1,” CEO Tim Livesay says. “It’s exactly these types of structural interplays that create the potential for mineable grades and widths in orogenic systems and we are keen to see how the analysis stacks up against the positive results received to date at Bibemi. “With a high success rate to date of intersecting gold mineralisation on the licence, we are confident the systems at Bibemi have the capacity to host an orogenic gold deposit,” he adds.
