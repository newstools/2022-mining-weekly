Emerging lithium/boron supplier ioneer is making progress with its planned secondary listing on the Nasdaq. The company, which owns the Rhyolite Ridge project in Nevada, has filed a registration statement on Form 20-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The form contemplates that securities will be issued pursuant to a Level 2 American Depository Receipt (ADR) programme. Once certain remaining conditions have been satisfied, Nasdaq will provide the company with an initial date for trading of the ADRs. ioneer's shares are currently listed on the ASX. If the ADR programme is established, it will complement the existing Australian listing.
