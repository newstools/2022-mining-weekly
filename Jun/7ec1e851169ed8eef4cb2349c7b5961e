London-listed Petra Diamonds' sixth tender for the 2022 financial year earned it $93-million in revenue from the sale of 569 496 ct of diamonds. “The Tender 6 results conclude a strong year for Petra’s diamond sales both in terms of pricing and the demand we have seen. The significant interest shown at Tender 6 bears testament to the ongoing strength of the rough diamond market. "We have seen pricing support across our product mix, with particular strength in the prices of both white and coloured gem-quality stones over the last 12 months,” says CEO Richard Duffy. Like-for-like rough diamond prices increased by 7.7% compared with the fifth tender. The latest tender results took sales for the financial year ended June 30 to 3.54-million carats, earning revenue of $584.5-million. That compares with the 3.96-million carats sold in the 2021 financial for $406.9-million. Petra noted that like-for-like prices for the full year had been 41.5% higher than in the 2021 financial year.
