PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (Amec) has today launched the Amec Critical Minerals Investment Opportunities document in three languages aimed at informing Asian investors of the investment opportunities in the country. “There is a growing investment interest in Asia for renewable sources of energy, particularly those offered by Australia’s vast critical minerals potential, and with a historic trade agreement signed with India earlier this year, we need to be attracting more foreign investment,” said Amec CEO Warren Pearce. “The document is a visual showcase of Australia’s outstanding critical minerals projects to attract investment to our emerging critical minerals sector, and we’re pleased to be able to offer this in three more languages.” The document, which was translated into Chinese, Japanese and Hindi, was compiled through support from the Western Australian government’s Access Asia Business Grant, showing that the state government is keen to help the resources sector to advance and expand its competitiveness in Asian markets and contribute to WA’s economic diversification, said Pearce. “On the back of exponential growth in global demand for renewable batteries and other downstream critical minerals offerings, governments are seeking to diversify and expand our local supply chains, starting with exploration and mining projects identified in this document,” said Pearce. Designed to pique investor interest in the emerging market, Amec’s document identifies 48 of Australia’s key critical minerals projects, from greenfield exploration to those nearing development, across a wide range of critical minerals. “Amec’s previous iterations of the document have already attracted domestic and international interest to these projects located all around Australia. With the translation of the document into languages targeting strategic partners and markets, we expect this to spur further investor interest,” said Pearce.
