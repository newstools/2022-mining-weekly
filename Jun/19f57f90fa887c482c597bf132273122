Australia-based Firefinch on Tuesday announced that its two recently appointed nonexecutive directors had resigned. Liz Wall and Naomi Scott, whose appointments were announced at the end of May, had resigned with effect from Monday, the ASX-listed company said, without providing reasons for the resignations. When Firefinch announced Wall and Scott’s appointments, the company said that they would bring deep African mining experience to the board, together with expertise in community, environment, people, governance, permitting, operations and transactions in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Firefinch owns the Morila gold mine, in Mali, and recently demerged its lithium assets, retaining a 20% interest in Leo Lithium.
