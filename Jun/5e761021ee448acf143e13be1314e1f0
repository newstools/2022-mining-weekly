Menck joined Nexa in 2016 and served as head of treasury and investor relations before being nominated as CFO in January 2019. President and CEO Ignacio Rosado thanked Menck for his contribution to the company. “Rodrigo helped us build a solid capital structure to support our future success. We wish him success in his future endeavour,” he said. In the interim, Claudio Torres, head of corporate controller, has been appointed CFO. Torres is a senior professional with more than 20 years of expertise in finance, controlling and risk management.
