PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths developer Hastings Technology Metals has marked the first construction blast at its A$658-million Yangibana project, in Western Australia. The company said on Tuesday that the blast represented the start of the next phase of infrastructure development works at Yangibana, on the way to a target of ore commissioning by the second half of 2024. “The Hastings team is progressing on many work fronts at Yangibana, ably supported by its trusted contracting partners. Getting the airstrip, communications and accommodation infrastructure is vital to allow the activation of the large workforce required to commence process plant construction once a final investment decision has been announced. Hastings is excited by progress made to date and is on track for commissioning during the latter part of 2024,” said Hastings COO Andrew Reid. Updated project economics for Yangibana estimates that the project will require a capital investment of A$658-million, with Yangibana expected to have a mine life of 15 years, producing 15 000 t/y of mixed rare earth carbonate, containing 3 400 t/y of neodymium praseodymium.
