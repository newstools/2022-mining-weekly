TSX-V-listed Deep-South Resources has advised that the hearing held on June 23, in its matter against Namibia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy, resulted in the court ordering the parties to file their case management reports by June 27. The next case management hearing will be held on June 30. The case management hearing serves to prepare the final hearing. Several aspects can be discussed at the case management hearing, such as the number of days required for the final hearing, any issues that are likely to facilitate a just and speedy resolution of the case or potential settlement prospects. The matter relates to the renewal of the exclusive prospecting licence 3140 covering Deep-South’s Haib copper project, in southern Namibia, which was refused by Namibia Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo in June 2021. At the time, the Ministry cited Deep-South’s inability to advance the licence to prefeasibility study (PFS) stage and complete a proposed drill programme as planned. The company maintains the issue was a misunderstanding and that government remained apprised on a proposed change from a PFS to an upgraded preliminary economic assessment to be done on the project instead, as well as the start of a full feasibility study.
