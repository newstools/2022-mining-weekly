Multi-commodity project generator Transition Metals is hoping to find business arrangements for ten of its projects at the Prospectors and Developers of Canada (PDAC) conference in Toronto, which starts on Monday. The projects on offer boast gold, nickel, copper, platinum-group metals, copper and uranium resources and are located across Canada. “One of our main objectives for attending the conference is to find partners for high-quality projects within our 22-property portfolio. With interest on the rise, companies looking for new projects are encouraged to contact our team,” said CEO Scott McLean. McLean, COO Greg Collins and VP exploration Tom Hart will be attending PDAC this week.
