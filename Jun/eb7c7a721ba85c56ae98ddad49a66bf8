PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Syrah Resources on Friday said that temporary logistical suspensions and suspensions to personnel movements on its primary transport route in Mozambique had been lifted. The company last week implemented a number of measures following an insurgent attack at the nearby Ancuabe graphite mine, which left two people dead. While maintaining mining and processing operations at its Balama graphite project, the company suspended all personnel and logistics movement through areas affected by the attack. Syrah on Friday told shareholders that these precautionary measures had now been lifted based on direct monitoring and security assessments from qualified third parties. The company said that it continues to maintain close contact with the Mozambique government, security authorities and other stakeholders to monitor security in the region, and to ensure the safety of its employees and contractors.
