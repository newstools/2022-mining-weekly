TSX-V-listed Northern Graphite has engaged a public affairs advisory firm called Navigator to assist the company in securing government support to advance its Bisset Creek graphite mine, in Ontario. Northern Graphite is in the process of garnering financing to construct the mine. The company also seeks support to extend the mine life and expand production at the Lac-des-Îles graphite mine, in Quebec, and to build a battery anode material manufacturing facility in Canada. Quebec and Ontario have expressed support for the critical minerals industry, and have programmes in place to promote mine production and value-added processing. CEO Hugues Jacquemin believes Northern Graphite is well positioned to participate in the development of the critical minerals industry in Canada, particularly since graphite is the largest component in a lithium-ion battery. “Graphite needs the largest production increase of any battery mineral to meet forecast electric vehicle demand,” he notes. Northern Graphite is the only significant graphite producing company in North America and will become the third-largest producer outside of China, once its Namibian operations come back on line in the first half of 2023, following plant upgrades.
