PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Laneway Resources has restarted mining activities at the Agate Creek project, in Queensland, with drill and blast operations under way. Production grade control sampling, assaying and blasting have started, with the first production blast for 2022 fired last Friday. The mining fleet is expected to mobilise next week, and the mining of high-grade ore will follow immediately. “We are pleased with the continuing rapid progress being made towards gold production. With mining activities underway and good progress on the restart of the Georgetown plant there is a clear pathway for Laneway to execute on its significant growth pipeline,” said MD Brad Gordon. Laneway in May started A$2.5-million refurbishment activities at the Georgetown gold processing plant to allow the start of ore processing through the plant in the coming months. The company said on Wednesday that the restart of the Georgetown plant would enable Laneway to take control over its gold production future, generate material free cashflow and begin building the platform for a regional gold processing centre.
