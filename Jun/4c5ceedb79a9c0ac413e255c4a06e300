Employees at Harmony Gold's operations, in the Free State, have pledged R1-million worth of donations to the KwaZulu-Natal government in response to the recent floods that left over 7 600 people homeless.

The donations included 200 mattresses, 283 blankets, 130 pillows, 242 fitted sheets, clothes, toiletries, groceries valued at R400 000 and a R600 000 cheque was handed over to the KwaZulu-Natal government by Harmony executive director Harry Mashego last week.

“We are inspired by the support from Harmony Gold Mining employees and various stakeholders for the support given to the people of KwaZulu-Natal during this time,” Premier Sihle Zikalala said.
