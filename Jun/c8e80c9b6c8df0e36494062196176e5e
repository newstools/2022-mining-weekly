Informal settlements in the mining areas around the Bojanala and Dr Kenneth Kaunda districts, in the North West, will soon be upgraded as the provincial Department of Human Settlements sets out to fast-track upgrades. The expanding informal settlements are close to mining areas and mainly house migrant workers. North West Human Settlements MEC Lenah Miga says the department has the responsibility to improve housing conditions in the informal settlements, as well as to improve the well-being of North West communities.
