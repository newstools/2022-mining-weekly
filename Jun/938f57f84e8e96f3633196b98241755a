Mineral exploration and development company Cornish Lithium has entered into an exclusive agreement with Rodda’s, the iconic Cornish clotted cream producer, to work together to evaluate suitable sites on land owned by Rodda’s, where geothermal lithium production and geothermal heat could be investigated.
 
Cornish Lithium will be designing and drilling a small research borehole to test for the viability of a commercial scale geothermal lithium and heat project. It is envisaged that Rodda’s will be able to use the resulting renewable geothermal heat to potentially decarbonise production processes at its Scorrier-based creamery, near Redruth.
   
“A successful geothermal lithium and heat project in Cornwall will demonstrate the potential for creating a truly sustainable source of lithium to support the UK’s growing battery industry while at the same time helping to decarbonise local businesses and provide them with a more sustainable future energy source. “Partnering with a global brand such as Rodda’s positions Cornwall, once again, at the forefront of the UK’s green industrial revolution and will also help to secure skilled jobs for local people,” says Cornish Lithium founder and CEO Jeremy Wrathall. Rodda’s MD Nicholas Rodda says the exploration project could provide valuable information around using geothermal waters as a source of heat energy. “Rodda’s utilises heat in its production processes which is currently generated using natural gas. By creating a renewable geothermal heat source for Rodda’s, there is a significant opportunity to make our production processes even more environmentally friendly.”
