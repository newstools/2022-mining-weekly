Battery minerals investor Vision Blue Resources has nominated Tony Trahar, a former CEO of global miner Anglo American, as its representative to the board of directors of exploration and development junior Cornish Metals. Trahar is a special adviser to Sir Mick Davis’ Vision Blue Resources, which in April made a £25-million investment in Cornish Metals – a TSX-V- and Aim-listed company reopening the historic South Crofty tin mine in the UK. From 2000 to 2007, Trahar was CEO of Anglo American and was also a director of AngloGold Ashanti, Anglo Platinum and De Beers. Prior to this, he was CEO and then chairperson of multinational forestry, pulp, paper and packaging group Mondi. "We are very pleased to welcome Mr Trahar to the board of Cornish Metals. Tony's experience in all aspects of the mining industry will be a tremendous asset to Cornish Metals as we advance South Crofty and assess additional value-adding opportunities that may be presented to us,” said Cornish Metals CEO Richard Williams. Trahar commented that he was delighted to be joining the board of Cornish Metals and to be part of the project to bring South Crofty back into production. “The South Crofty project is financially and environmentally sound, will add a new secure source of supply to the western world's needs of energy metals and will also provide significant employment and economic growth in the Camborne - Pool - Redruth area of Cornwall."
