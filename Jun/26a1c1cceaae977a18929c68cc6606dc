ASX- and Aim-listed minerals sands producer Base Resources has advised of heavy rainstorms impacting its Kwale operations, in Kenya. A series of rainstorms in recent days have caused flash flooding, which overwhelmed the project’s dewatering system for the three operating hydraulic mining units (HMUs). The company says recovery work is under way, with one of the three HMUs back in operation and delivering about 45% of normal mining volumes. The remaining two HMUs are not operating as they continue to be dewatered and to undergo pump motor replacement. While Base cannot yet say when full mining volumes will resume, it is certain that its production guidance for the full year will need to be revised in coming weeks.
