TSX-V-listed Group Ten Metals is rebranding to Stillwater Critical Minerals to reflect the potential its sees in the iconic and famously productive Stillwater mining district of Montana, in the US. The company’s flagship project is the Stillwater West project, which hosts eight metals – nickel, cobalt, chromium, palladium, platinum, rhodium, iridium and ruthenium – all designated as critical by the US government with a mandate to secure domestic supplies based on economic and national security concerns. Stillwater West also hosts significant copper resources. "With the recent addition of two renowned Bushveld and Platreef geologists to our team we are well-positioned to advance the next phase of large-scale critical mineral supply from the district, building on past production of nickel, copper, and chromium, and the on-going production of platinum group and other metals by our neighbor, Sibanye-Stillwater," commented CEO Michael Rowley. He said that the company's Platreef-style nickel and copper sulphide deposits contained a compelling suite of critical minerals and were open for expansion along trend and at depth. "We look forward to further announcements including assay results from our 2021 resource expansion drill campaign and our 2022 exploration plans in the near term." The company's stock symbols remain unchanged as PGE on the TSX-V, PGEZF on the OTCQB and 5D32 on the FSE.
