Uranium developer Denison Mines has entered into a participation and funding agreement with Kineepik Métis Local #9 (KML), which expresses a mutual commitment to the co-development of an agreement supporting the advancement of the in-situ recovery (ISR) operation proposed at the Wheeler River uranium project, in Saskatchewan. The participation agreement builds on an existing letter agreement between Denison and KML with respect to the support of KML's contributions to, and participation in, the federal and provincial environmental assessment process for the Wheeler River project. Further, Denison and KML have entered into an exploration agreement in respect of Denison's exploration and evaluation activities within KML's land and occupancy area. KML represents the Métis rights holders who live and practice traditional activities in the vicinity of the Wheeler River project and the municipality of the Village of Pinehouse. Métis Citizens of KML have substantive ties to the territory in the Athabasca Basin region that includes Denison's Wheeler River project and several exploration properties located between the McArthur River mine and Key Lake mill. The participation agreement and exploration agreement were signed in the Village of Pinehouse during the annual Elders Gathering festivities, which are being held this year during the week of National Indigenous Peoples Day on June 21.
