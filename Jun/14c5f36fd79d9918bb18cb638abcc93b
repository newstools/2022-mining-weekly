Gemstone miner Gemfields reports that several insurgent attacks in the vicinity of Ancuabe, Mozambique, starting on June 6, are happening in closer proximity to its Montpuez ruby mine (MRM) than in the past. Ancuabe, a town in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, lies about 65 km east-northeast of the MRM – in which Gemfields holds a 75% stake. Most of the earlier insurgent activity occurred more than 150 km to the northeast of MRM. The recent incidents occurred between 15 km and 40 km north of the N1 and N14 roads – the principal route used by MRM to travel to and from the coastal town of Pemba, the provincial capital. However, in the second week of June, military escorts were accompanying civilian vehicles on the stretch of road closer to Pemba. The attacks earlier in June reportedly included the killing of two employees of the Ancuabe graphite project owned by Grafex Limitada – a subsidiary of Australia-headquartered Triton Minerals. While MRM’s mining and processing operations remain unaffected, MRM has implemented certain travel restrictions to protect its employees and movement of goods.
