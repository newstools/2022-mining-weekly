Canadian gold exploration company E2Gold has closed its previously announced private placement, raising $2.5-million with a lead order from precious metals miner Kinross Gold. The company issued 14.38-million units at $0.06 each and 6.63-million flow-through units at $0.085 each to raise the proceeds. “The commitment of Kinross Gold through this investment is an important validation of our activities and projects, as itsthe continued support of significant shareholders, such as Crescat Capital and others,” said E2Gold president Ellie Owens. He further stated that with drill planning at Band Ore and drill target development at Hawkins both under way, the financing put E2 in an “excellent position to capitalise on a rising market”. The Hawkins gold project is in north-central Ontario, about 140 km east of the Hemlo gold mine.
