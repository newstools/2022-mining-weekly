State-owned Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) will start with the yearly maintenance shutdown of its North Corridor on July 12. The shutdown is scheduled for completion by July 22 and is important for TFR’s volume recovery plans for the corridor. The maintenance and repair work will cover Richards Bay to Pyramid South, with key maintenance activities taking place on the Richards Bay to Ermelo section and the DC section between Ermelo and the mines as well as the Pyramid section. “Plans are at an advanced stage for the successful execution of this megaproject, [which is] aimed at uplifting 16 temporary speed restrictions equating to 34 km of railway track. This project will see the restoration of eight slots in the network for the North Corridor,” TFR says. The scope of work to be executed during the shutdown includes formation rehabilitation, turnout component replacement, drainage repair and sleeper replacement, besides others. “The North Corridor shutdown is planned to coincide with the shutdowns by our critical stakeholders to enable them to perform their own maintenance to their infrastructure,” says TFR North Corridor managing executive Ali Motala. “Maintenance shutdowns are an essential part of the business as they ensure routine maintenance work is performed, which supports railway operations and improves business competences. “The benefits will include the improvement of the deteriorated network conditions to create resilient infrastructure and accelerate the network renewal programme,” he adds.
