US-based mineral developer Paramount Gold has appointed mining engineer Samantha Espley to its board as independent director. Espley is currently as a senior executive adviser for Stantec Engineering and recently as a corporate director with Vale, the world’s biggest nickel and iron-ore producer. Her global experience includes managing operations, geology, and engineering with many industry leaders including Inco, Falconbridge, Dome, Denison-Potacan and Noranda. Espley is the former President of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), and has remained active in several roles on the board of directors of the CIM. “Samantha is joining our board at a critical time as we approach permitting approval for our underground Grassy Mountain gold mine. Her immense experience in building and managing underground mining operations will be an invaluable asset to the company and strengthens our board significantly as we make the transition to a producer,” commented Paramount chairperson Rudi Fronk. Espley, a fellow with the Canadian Academy of Engineering, is a professional engineer with a degree from the University of Toronto and a Masters of Applied Science & Engineering, which she received from Laurentian University.
