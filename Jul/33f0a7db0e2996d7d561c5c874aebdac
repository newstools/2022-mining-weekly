There seems to be no end in sight yet for the strike at the Raglan nickel mine, in Quebec, with the United Steelworkers Union (USW) Local 9449 on Thursday withdrawing from mediated negotiations. The strike at the Glencore-owned mine in Quebec is now in its sixth week. Some mining activities are currently under way, with operations carried out by professional staff and contractors who were already performing similar work prior to the dispute. "We are disappointed that the union is not willing to give the negotiation process a chance, while we were ready to pursue meaningful discussions," said Raglan VP Pierre Barrette. "We are convinced that we could have reached a mutually beneficial agreement, given the improvements in all aspects of workers' conditions that were included in the global offer," continued Barrette. Raglan was aiming to reach an agreement by July 10 and hopes that the union will return to the table by then to settle the dispute. Glencore said that Raglan had tabled a global offer that provided employees with competitive wages and working conditions that it claimed were among the best in the Canadian mining industry. The turnover rate at Raglan has averaged 5.3% over the past five years, while the industry average is over 10%. According to annual surveys conducted by Raglan, employee satisfaction stands at 86%. Employees on fly-in, fly-out schedules work less than half the year and are paid 2.3 to 3.3 times the average wage in all regions of Quebec.
