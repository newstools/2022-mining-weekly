Fernando Porcile, who was responsible for developing several mining projects and operating various world-class operations, has passed away, Canadian miner Los Andes Copper reports. “Fernando has been an influential and larger-than-life presence in the mining industry for over 50 years," Los Andes said of its past executive chairperson. His experience working with major mining companies was vast and varied and included being the director of the Coldeco board, president of Compañía Doña Inés de Collahuasil, president of the Falconbridge copper business unit and project development VP for BHP Billiton’s base metals division. More recently, Porcile was a prominent driving force in the development of Los Andes and its Vizcachitas project, in Chile. “All of us at Los Andes Copper pass our condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Fernando. Our company continues to benefit from the engineering experience and design insight he brought to the Vizcachitas copper project,” said CEO Michael Jones.
