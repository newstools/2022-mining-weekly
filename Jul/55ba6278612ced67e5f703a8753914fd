PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Okapi Resources will raise A$2.5-million in a share placement to complete the diamond drilling programme at the Enmore gold project, in New South Wales, which started in June, and to fund the Athabasca North American summer exploration programme, and for general working capital. The ASX-listed company on Thursday announced that it would place 16.6-million shares, at a price of 15c each, with one free attaching unlisted options for every two shares subscribed. The placement options will have an exercise price of 30c each and will expire two years from the date of issue. The placement includes A$131 000 in commitments from Okapi’s directors, subject to shareholder approval that will be sought at an extraordinary general meeting expected to occur in September 2022. “Okapi is now well positioned to maximise shareholder value through its exploration programmes which are now underway. The current global energy crisis has highlighted the need for western countries to secure clean, reliable and carbon-free energy – nuclear power is going to play an important role in achieving net-zero carbon,” MD Andrew Ferrier said.
