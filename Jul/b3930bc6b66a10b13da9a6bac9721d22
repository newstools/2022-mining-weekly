PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Regis Resources has reported record production in the June quarter, as well as the 2022 financial year. Gold production in the June quarter reached 123 901 oz, with the Duketon operation contributing 92 800 oz and the Tropicana mine contributing 31 100 oz. The June quarter production was a 20% increase on the 103 100 oz of gold produced in the March quarter. For the full year ending June, gold production also reached a record 437 300 oz, with Duketon contributing 315 500 oz and Tropicana contributing 121 800 oz. “We are very pleased to deliver a record quarter of gold production for the June 2022 quarter. We have seen reliable delivery on our improvement plans that were developed and implemented to address the operational challenges we experienced in the first half of the year. This has seen the company deliver an improved performance despite the challenging external conditions,” sad Regis MD Jim Beyer. “The result is a record production performance for the quarter and overall annual gold production that sits comfortably within 2022 production guidance. The company is now well set for increased annual gold production into 2023. We look forward to releasing the full June quarter report along with company guidance later in the month.” Regis noted that general industry inflationary pressures have continued across our operations and preliminary indications point to a full-year all-in sustaining cost slightly above the top end of 2022 cost guidance of between A$1 425/oz and A$1 500/oz. Confirmation of the final outcome will be provided in the June quarter report released later this month, the company said. The improved production performance over the June quarter delivered an increase in the cash and bullion balance of A$60-million to near A$227-million at the end of June.
