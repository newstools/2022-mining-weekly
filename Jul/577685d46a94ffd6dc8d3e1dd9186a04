PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Santos has awarded ASX-listed Worley a services contract to support its Bayu-Undan carbon capture and storage (CCS) project, in Timor-Leste. Under the contract, Worley will provide front-end engineering design (FEED) services for the Bayu-Undan offshore facilities and pipeline, including the re-purposing of the Bayu-Undan facility and the offshore section of the gas export pipeline from hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide (CO2) service. Worley will also provide FEED services for the life extension of the Bayu-Undan facility and pipeline to enable continued safe and reliable operation. The Bayu-Undan CCS project is expected to store up to 10-million tonnes a year of CO2 equivalent to about 1.5% of Australia’s annual carbon emissions. The project has the potential to be one of the largest CCS projects in the world and one of the many that will be critical to transitioning to a low-carbon future. “We are excited to strengthen our relationship with Santos and support this important CCS project. This project is one of the ways we are helping our customers to decarbonize and re-purpose existing assets as we deliver a more sustainable world,” said Worley CEO Chris Ashton. A final investment decision on Bayu-Undan CCS is targeted for 2023, subject to relevant regulatory frameworks and agreements being in place in both Timor-Leste and Australia.
