Anna Ladd-Kruger has been appointed to the board of Canadian precious metals company SilverCrest Metals. She brings a strong financial background and extensive mining industry experience from her more than 20-year career, the company says. “As we continue to advance the Las Chispas mine to commercial production, Ms. Ladd-Kruger's skill set and experience leading companies through various phases of development, including the transition to production, will be a valuable asset to the company,” states CEO Eric Fier. Throughout her career, Ladd-Kruger has held key executive positions at several Canadian publicly listed mining companies, including roles supporting the transition from exploration to production and raising substantial debt and equity. Most recently, Ladd-Kruger was the CFO of McEwen Mining, where she was brought in to lead financial and operational turnaround strategies and was key to the McEwen Copper asset spin-out, including serving as its CFO and director. Ladd-Kruger was previously the CFO of base metals company Trevali Mining, where she was part of the original executive management team that grew the company from a junior exploration firm into a midtier producer.
