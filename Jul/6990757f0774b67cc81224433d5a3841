North American gold mining company Osisko Development has advised of its subsidiary Barkerville Gold Mines entering into a participation agreement with Williams Lake First Nation (WLFN) to jointly develop the Cariboo gold project, in British Columbia. Osisko says the agreement supports the parties’ mutual vision of developing a socially and environmentally sustainable mine. “The agreement provides WLFN with a seat at the table and an enhanced opportunity to advance economic reconciliation principles, environmental stewardship and additional employment opportunities in the region,” says WLFN chief Willie Sellars. Osisko sustainable development VP Chris Pharness deems good relationships as vital for any endeavour to be successful and says the agreement speaks to the company’s desire to develop opportunities through collective sharing of culture and worldview.
