PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Potash developer BCI Minerals has announced the resignation of its MD and CEO Alwyn Vorster by the end of 2022. Vorster’s move comes shortly after BCI pushed back the first sales from its Mardie salt and potash project, in the Pilbara, from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the second half of 2025, and warned of cost blow-outs at the operation. BCI will now start the hunt for a new CEO as part of an orderly transition, the company said on Friday. “Vorster has been CEO of BCI since May 2016, having been CEO of Iron Ore Holdings for four years up to its acquisition by BCI in 2014. He has led the company through a period of great change, including the development of our flagship Mardie project from acquisition to commencement of construction,” BCI chairperson Brian O’Donnell said. “It has been a privilege leading BCI’s progress, from iron-ore exploration to our current flagship Mardie Salt and Potash project. During the transition period, I look forward to working with the BCI team to manage this period of industry headwinds,” Vorster added. “I am confident that we have created the building blocks for BCI to have a successful future, and am grateful for the support provided by our major shareholders, the board and BCI’s employees, and other important stakeholders.”
