Sweden-based Copperstone Resources has received feedback from the Land and Environmental Court at Umeå District Court and various consultation bodies, on additions to its environmental permit application for reopening the Viscaria copper mine, in Kiruna. After reviewing this feedback, Copperstone will submit supplementary information to the court in September. The process is proceeding as expected, confirms Copperstone environment and sustainability manager Anders Lundkvist, adding that the supplementary requirements allow the company to submit an application as complete as possible. Copperstone expects a final announcement on the environmental permit before the end of the year.
