NYSE- and Aim-listed Caledonia Mining, which owns and operates the Blanket gold mine, in Zimbabwe, has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14. Gold production so far this year has been strong and Caledonia says it is on track to reach targeted production of 73 000 oz to 80 000 oz of gold this year. The company is focused on becoming a multi-asset gold producer and it continues to evaluate investment opportunities in Zimbabwe and elsewhere. “Although the dividend continues to be a central part of our strategy, I am very excited with the opportunity that we have to evolve our business in Zimbabwe and de-risk it from being a single-asset producer,” comments CEO Mark Learmonth.
