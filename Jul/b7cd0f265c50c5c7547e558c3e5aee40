PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The green energy arm of Fortescue Metals, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) is looking at hydrogen options in Djibouti. FFI is partnering with the government of the Republic of Djibouti to conduct studies with a view to developing green hydrogen production in the region, and has signed a framework agreement to do as much. “Djibouti does not want to miss this historic moment when green hydrogen becomes the fuel for energy transition,” Djibouti Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Yonis Ali Guedi said. “This project has the potential for significant socioeconomic impact, in terms of job creation.” FFI CEO Julie Shuttleworth said the partnership with the government of the Republic of Djibouti was a great step towards lowering emissions and driving green energy projects forward. “Djibouti’s solar, wind and geothermal sites as well as its access to port, make it an attractive location for the production of green hydrogen. “FFI is committed to delivering social, environmental and economic benefits, and we look forward to working with the government of the Republic of Djibouti in this new venture,” Shuttleworth said. The deal provides FFI access and rights to study the possibilities of renewable energy resources in Djibouti which include solar, wind and geothermal sites, as well as subsurface gas storage areas and industrial areas. Depending on the outcome of FFI’s studies, the parties may then negotiate the terms on an Investment Agreement to develop and construct green hydrogen production facilities on that land.
