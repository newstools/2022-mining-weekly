PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer Bellevue Gold has awarded an A$87.8-million engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the one-million-tonne-a-year processing plant at its namesake project, in Western Australia. The contract was awarded to ASX-listed GR Engineering on a fixed contract price basis. As part of the contract, Bellevue can pay up to A$7.5-million of the contract price to GR Engineering in Bellevue shares, aligning GR Engineering with the project and reducing Bellevue’s pre-production cash funding requirement. The EPC contract is the last of the large capital expenditure items on the pathway to production, meaning 90% of the project’s pre-production expenditure is locked in either via contracts or tenders, Bellevue said on Wednesday. The processing plant has been designed so that throughput can be expanded to 1.2-million tonnes a year at no additional expense, allowing for ongoing organic growth at the project.
