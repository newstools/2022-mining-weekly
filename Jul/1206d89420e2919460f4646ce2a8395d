Lighting manufacturer Visionware will be showcasing its industrial lighting range at this year’s Electra Mining Africa exhibition, which will be held in September. The Kempton Park-based company focuses on the in-house design and local manufacturing of products for the electrical switchgear and lighting market. The V-Light brand aims to introduce new innovative light-emitting diode (LED) lighting products that are specifically designed for intended applications. “Our unique solutions enable power consumption to be at an all-time low, eliminate lamp failures and keep maintenance to a minimum. Motion sensors and day/night switches can be built into the light unit to further advance power-saving features.” These features are particularly key for applications where lighting is essential to create and enable safety and productivity. In terms of its design and features, the V-Light LED is designed with 6063 aluminium alloy and extruded to a unique architectural form. Further processes involve hard anodizing for a seamless finishing, ensuring durability and a high resistance to corrosion. The V-Light range’s unique architectural form also allows for optimal cooling with its down facing fin design, which enables the complete unit to run at efficient temperatures – even in heavy dusty environments without overheating and compromising its longevity. Available in 30/60 or 120 W, the V-Light range provides lighting solutions for warehouses, industrial and factory buildings, commercial buildings, mining conveyor systems and general street lighting. All designs can be customized to fit specific requirements for individual projects, the company says.
