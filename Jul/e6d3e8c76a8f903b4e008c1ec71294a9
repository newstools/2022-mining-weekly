Canada-based B2Gold is set for a strong second half, with its three operating mines forecast to significantly increase production to between 560 000 oz and 590 000 oz in the last six months of the year. This compares with 405 331 oz in the first half of the year, which was 2% above budget. The forecast increase in second-half production is owing to the timing of high-grade ore production, particularly at Fekola, in Mali, B2Gold reported on Thursday. The Fekola mine produced 123 066 oz in the second quarter, which was in line with its budget. B2Gold noted that the mine continued to operate normally during the sanctions the Economic Community of West African States imposed on Mali in January. The sanctions were removed on July 3. B2Gold also operates Masbate, in the Philippines, which produced well above its target for the quarter. Masbate’s output of 114 139 oz was 6% higher than budgeted, owing to improved mill throughput. In light of the mine’s strong performance, Masbate is now expected to produce between 215 000 oz and 225 000 oz in 2022. The original guidance was 205 000 oz to 215 000 oz. The Otjikoto mine, in Namibia, produced 31 417 oz in the second quarter, which was 6% below budget, owing to a slower-than-planned ramp-up in development of the Wolfshag underground mine. B2Gold said it had appointed a new underground contractor and that development rates in the underground mine had recovered, with development ore now expected in the third quarter of 2022 and stope ore production starting in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result of this change in ore production timing, the 2022 yearly production guidance range for Otjikoto has been revised to between 165 000 oz and 175 000 oz of gold. The original guidance range was between 175 000 oz and 185 000 oz of gold. Overall, the group said it would achieve its full-year guidance of between 990 000 oz and 1.05-million ounces, including 40 000 oz to 50 000 oz of attributable production projected from Calibre.
