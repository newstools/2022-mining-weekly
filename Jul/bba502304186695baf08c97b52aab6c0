PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Alicanto Minerals has reported a maiden inferred resource of 311 000 t of contained zinc, 15-million ounces of silver and 44 000 t of lead at its Sala project, in Sweden. The ASX-listed explorer announced an independent inferred mineral resource estimate of 9.7-million tonnes, at 4.5% zinc equivalent for Sala, which included a high-grade core from surface of 4.5-million tonnes at 6% zinc equivalent. “This is an outstanding maiden resource which demonstrates the growing scale and quality of the Sala project,” said Alicanto MD Peter George. “The fact that we established such a substantial resource in just over a year of taking ownership also highlights the strength of the mineralisation and the immense ongoing growth potential. “We believe there is significant inventory growth to come, with the mineralisation open in every direction and numerous highly prospective targets to drill. We will maintain the pace of drilling to unlock the full value of this asset, creating significant value for Alicanto shareholders in the process.” George told shareholders that the resource is considered to be of a Stage One nature, with substantial growth expected given the mineralisation is open in all directions and drilling is ongoing.
