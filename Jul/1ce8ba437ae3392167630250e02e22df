Dual-listed Gemfields says an attack, attributed to insurgent activity, occurred on July 13 in closer proximity to the operations of Montepuez Ruby Mining (MRM), in which Gemfields holds a 75% interest, than prior incidents. The attack reportedly took place in the Muaja village area, which is about 30 km by road from MRM. A large number of people are reportedly relocating to Nanhupo and Namanhumbir, where the mining operations are located, the company says. “Gemfields and MRM hold the health and safety of their employees and contractors as their highest priority and remain in regular contact with government authorities, as well as closely monitoring developments. “Given recent developments and the associated security review, operations continue with increased vigilance,” the company states. On July 13, Mining Weekly reported that Gemfields reported that several insurgent attacks in the vicinity of Ancuabe, Mozambique, starting on June 6, were happening in closer proximity to MRM than in the past. Ancuabe, a town in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique, lies about 65 km east-northeast of the MRM. Most of the earlier insurgent activity occurred more than 150 km to the northeast of MRM, Gemfields had reported. It had noted that the recent incidents occurred between 15 km and 40 km north of the N1 and N14 roads – the principal route used by MRM to travel to and from the coastal town of Pemba, the provincial capital. However, in the second week of June, military escorts were accompanying civilian vehicles on the stretch of road closer to Pemba, Gemfields had said. The attacks earlier in June reportedly resulted in the death of two employees of the Ancuabe graphite project owned by Grafex Limitada – a subsidiary of Australia-headquartered Triton Minerals.
