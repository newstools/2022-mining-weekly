Gold exploration and development company Panthera Resources expects to receive the assay results from a June drilling programme at its Bassala project, in Mali, later this month. As part of the drilling programme, 2 601 m of reverse circulation (RC) drilling was completed in 23 drill holes and 3 030 m of aircore drilling in 50 holes. Significant silica-chlorite-sulphide alteration and associated quartz veining were observed for most targeted intervals, Panthera reports. Samples have been submitted to the SGS laboratory, in Bamako, for assay. "The continued and rapid progress at Bassala is a credit to our operations team in Mali. The project has been accelerated from a grassroots prospect through a gold-in-soil and geophysics survey, and two drilling programmes in 2021 for 18 935 m. "The June 2022 AC drilling programme, comprising 5 631 m, was again completed on time and within budget with no safety incidents reported," comments Panthera MD Mark Bolton.
