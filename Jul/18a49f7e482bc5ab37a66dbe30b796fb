PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Nickel miner Panoramic Resources has set a production target for 2023 at its Savannah project, in Western Australia, after achieving commercial production. The company said on Wednesday that the achievement of commercial production from April 1 was an important milestone for the project following the first production of concentrate in October 2021. The ramp-up of underground mining will continue throughout the 2023 financial year as development of additional levels opens up new areas for production, from Savannah North. For the full 2023 financial year, Savannah is expected to produce between 6 600 t and 7 100 t of nickel in concentrate, between 4 100 t and 4 500 t of copper in concentrate and between 400 t to 500 t of cobalt in concentrate. C1 cost guidance for the project has been estimated at between A$7.30/lb and A$8/30/lb, with Panoramic expected to spend between A$20-million and A$28-million on mine development in the financial year, and between A$14-million and A$18-million on capital and growth expenditure.
