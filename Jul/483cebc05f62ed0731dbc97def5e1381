PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Element 25 on Monday confirmed that it was currently in discussions with the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) and the Sarawak state government to potentially build its planned high purity manganese sulphate monohydrate (HPMSM) plant in Sarawak. Sarawak is one of the potential sites being considered for the construction of the first HPMSM plant, and a feasibility study is currently under way, which include localisation studies to assess the suitability of the region. A scoping study completed earlier this year confirmed the economic benefits of an HPMSM plant that would process manganese concentrate from Element 25’s Butcherbird operation, in Western Australia. The scoping study estimated a modest start-up capital requirement of some $150-million and a $24-million working capital, producing at a base case of 50 000 t/y HPMSM. The scoping study also considered a 100 000 t/y output and a 150 00 t/y output, with an additional $86-million in capital cost requirements for each subsequent capacity increase. “Element 25 is moving rapidly towards achieving its goal of becoming a world-class, low-carbon battery materials manufacturer to supply the world’s growing need for sustainable battery materials,” said MD Justin Brown on Monday “We look forward to working closely with the Malaysian authorities to determine whether Sarawak is the optimal location for the development of our first processing facility as we pivot Element 25 to be a key participant in this emerging industry.” Brown noted that discussions were also ongoing with potential offtake partners with respect to an EU or US based location for either the first of subsequent conversion facility builds.
