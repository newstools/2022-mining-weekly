London-listed Gem Diamonds on July 16 recovered a high-quality 114 ct white Type I diamond from the Letšeng mine in Lesotho. Following the recovery of a 245 ct diamond in June and a 125 ct diamond in May, the 114 ct diamond represents the fourth diamond of over 100 ct recovered from the Letšeng mine in recent weeks. The Letšeng mine is among the ten biggest diamond producers by revenue. Gem notes that the large, high-value diamonds greater than 100 ct recovered at the mine contribute between 70% and 80% of its revenue every year.
