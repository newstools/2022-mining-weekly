PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Wiluna Mining has announced the immediate resignation of executive chairperson Milan Jerkovic, and the appointment of Rowan Johnston as interim non-executive chairperson. Michael Monaghan has been appointed as acting CEO, with Robert Ryan appointed as acting COO. The board reshuffle comes after Wiluna’s A$84.5-million capital raise initiative in May, to combat ramp-up delays at its Stage 1 operation caused by Covid-19 and skilled labour shortages, as well as inflationary cost pressures, the war in Ukraine, shipping delays of key equipment and delays to concentrate sales. “With the new flotation plant producing saleable concentrate and operating at a higher than name-plate capacity and improved specifications, the question of metallurgy has been answered. The gold is there, it can be extracted and recovered. With most of the upfront capital expenditure on the WilTails project already spent and its commissioning currently being targeted for October 2022, we will have a further revenue stream coming online,” said Johnston on Wednesday. “Now we will focus on finalising a realistic, executable mine plan over the coming months that will provide a return to our shareholders, while also ensuring a focus on cost management. This is reflected in the addition of Monaghan and Ryan to the executive management team both well respected and experienced in underground mining engineering. And on behalf of the company and myself, I would like to thank Jerkovic for his tireless efforts, belief and contribution to the company and wish him all the best for the future.”
