Business Unity South Africa (Busa) has outlined a set of ten interventions that it believes could unlock much-needed investment into new generation and storage capacity over the coming two years and should be included as part of President Cyril Ramaphosa's comprehensive plan for tackling load-shedding, which is expected to be unveiled soon. The Busa intervention envisages the introduction of 15 GW of additional generation capacity, together with 4 GW of battery storage, over a 24-month period. The organisation calculates that 3 GW of that will be supplied by Eskom, while a further 3.5 GW will arise from ongoing procurement programmes and as a result of policy reforms. Busa believes the 9 GW balance, which would involve investments of about R170-billion, could be unlocked through the following interventions: “We hope that the President’s announcement will provide a clear path, with deadlines, that demonstrate the urgency with which the proposed actions will be implemented,” CEO Cas Coovadia said in a statement. “Once it is announced, we would like to see a joint government and business working team configured and deployed to focus on delivering results against hard deadlines. “This includes working towards deliverables that are communicated regularly, both to the President and to the public,” Coovadia added. During the height of the Covid crisis business worked with government on a range of interventions, including the acquisition of vaccines, and Business for South Africa's (B4SA's) steering committee, which coordinated business’ actions, has been re-mobilised as Busa’s implementation arm. “Business is ready to intensify its participation and deploy its expertise, capacity and resources to support the President and assist government to stabilise the country’s energy sector,” B4SA steering committee chair Martin Kingston said. “The sooner the conditions for investment are in place, the sooner the country will be able to unlock the funding needed,” Kingston added.
