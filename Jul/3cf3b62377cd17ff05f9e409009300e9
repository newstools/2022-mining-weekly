TSX-V-listed diamond miner Diamcor Mining sold 1 939.81 ct of rough diamonds in its first tender for the second quarter ending September 30. The tender generated gross revenues of $478 391.90, with diamonds sold at an average price of $246.62/ct. The diamonds were recovered from the processing of quarry material from the company’s Krone-Endora at Venetia project, in South Africa. CEO Dean Taylor says the results of this first tender are evidence of strong demand for Diamcor’s rough diamonds, given their overall quality. Meanwhile, Diamcor also recovered two gem-quality rough diamonds in the specials category – a 59.25 ct and a 21.85 ct diamond, which have been delivered and are expected to be tendered in August. “Our efforts continue to focus on increasing processing volumes, and the recovery of two large gem-quality rough diamonds in the specials category from our recently upgraded facilities at this point is yet further confirmation of the project’s potential for large, high-value gem-quality rough diamonds,” he adds.
