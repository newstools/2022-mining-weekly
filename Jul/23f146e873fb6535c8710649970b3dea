Toronto-listed Monarch Mining has recruited Benoit Desormeaux to its board of directors, which has now grown to six. “The timing of his appointment is perfect, as we recently restarted our operations at Beaufor mine and Beacon mill and are looking to pursue the development of our gold operations and our promising mining assets, namely McKenzie Break, Swanson and Croinor Gold,” commented chairperson Michael Bouchard. Desormeaux is a seasoned mining executive with more than 12 years of board experience and is also a proven mining CEO, having risen through the ranks of Semafo from 1997 to 2020, including as COO and CFO. He has a strong operations background, having operated four mines in three West African countries. “Benoit’s valuable experience, which notably led to the $1.6-billion sale of Semafo to Endeavour Mining, will help secure our success as we strive to become a 100 000-plus-ounce gold mining producer,” said Bouchard.
