An Ecuadorian court has reaffirmed the mining concessions for Loma Larga, Canada-based gold mining company Dundee Precious Metals (DPM) reported on Wednesday. The Judicial Labour Unit of Cuenca has delivered an oral decision on the Constitutional Protective Action filed against the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (MAATE), upholding the validity of the company’s environmental permits for exploration at Loma Larga and confirming that the MAATE did not violate certain rights relating to the protection of water and nature in granting the permits. The court also found that the company would be required to include the local indigenous populations in its consultation process prior to proceeding to the exploitation phase, which DPM said it had already planned as part of its development of the project, in line with International Finance Corporation practices. The written decision is expected to be delivered within a week’s time, following which the claimants have three days to file an appeal of the decision. During this time, DPM’s drilling activities will remain paused, pending the company’s assessment of the written decision and the impact of any appeals that are filed. DPM said it continued to work closely with the MAATE and other local stakeholders to advance permitting for the project, which recently included the receipt of the technical viability certificate for the filtered tailings storage facility at the end of June. “This is a positive step forward for the Loma Larga project. As a significant foreign investor in Ecuador, we expect to create substantial economic and social opportunities through the responsible development of the project. “We are fully committed to working collaboratively and transparently with stakeholders in line with the highest applicable standards for environmental protection and stakeholder engagement,” Dundee president and CEO David Rae said.
