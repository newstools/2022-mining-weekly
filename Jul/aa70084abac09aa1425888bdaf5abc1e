PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ore mining has started at the Lindi Jumbo graphite mine, in Tanzania. ASX-listed Walkabout Resources on Friday said that the first production blast was successfully completed at the end of June, and mining of the pit has now started. The ore will be stockpiled for use in the commissioning of the processing plant. “The first blast and mining of the starter pit is a new chapter in the development of the Lindi Jumbo graphite mine and for Tanzania, as it also represents the commencement of the first high-grade, large flake stockpile of responsibly sourced graphite in Tanzania,” said CEO Andrew Cunningham. “The effort and expertise put in by our earthmoving contractor TNR, as well as our Lindi Jumbo team on site to conduct the inaugural blast in a safe and controlled operation was a proud moment for all involved.” Construction of the tailings storage facility is nearing completion, while civil works at the processing plant are 83% complete. The Lindi Jumbo project will be connected to grid power through two lines through an agreement with the Tanzanian Electrtical Supply Company and installation of a 33 kV powerline is now complete and reaches to the project site. Once the transformer has been installed, grid power will be available to support the completion of construction activities. Installation of a 4.5 MW powerline is also progressing, and on completion, the line will supply continuous power for the entire operation once commissioning starts. Over its 24-year mine life, the Lindi Jumbo project is expected to produce 40 000 t/y of graphite concentrate.
