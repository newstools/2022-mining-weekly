PERTH (Miningweekly.com) – The A$278-million Binduli North heap leach gold project, was officially opened by owner Norton Gold Fields at the end of last week. Located around 10 km west of Kalgoorlie, the project created 300 jobs during construction and will employ 200 workers during production. The operation has an estimated 10-year life span and is expected to produce an average of 75 000 oz/y of gold. Once the heap leach facility reaches capacity, the additional output will place Norton among Western Australia’s top 10 gold producers, with the company recently producing up to 180 000 oz/y of gold from its Eastern Goldfields tenements. Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston has congratulated Norton on its heap leach project, saying it will deliver millions in royalties to the Western Australian economy. "It's always pleasing to see companies like Norton driving growth in Western Australia's regional communities. With more than A$16-billion of sales in 2021 and as Western Australia's second most valuable commodity, gold will continue to play a significant role in our economic future."
