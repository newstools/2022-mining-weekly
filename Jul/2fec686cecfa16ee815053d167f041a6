Under the terms of the agreement, GGG can earn its interest in TME by spending A$3-million on a jointly agreed works programme in relation to the tenement within three years from the date of satisfaction of the conditions precedent. Welsbach is a related party of GGG by virtue of being an entity controlled by GGG MD Daniel Mamadou, one of three directors of Welsbach and owner of a controlling shareholding interest in Welsbach. The transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including completion of due diligence by GGG on TME and its assets, and GGG obtaining shareholder approval.
