Ghana-focused lithium exploration and development company Atlantic Lithium plans on listing in Australia, in addition to its listing on the Aim market in London. The company has appointed Australian firm Canaccord Genuity to manage the ASX listing process. Atlantic, which is headquartered in Australia, says the listing will increase exposure of the company’s Ewoyaa project and Cape Coast portfolio to resources investors and enable wider trading of the company’s shares. The ASX listing will also allow Australian investors the opportunity to reposition securities held in the UK to Australia. “The ASX market has seen a growing interest in green commodities of late, in line with the global transition to a lower-carbon future, and we have seen the valuations of many companies involved in the lithium supply chain benefit as a result. “We feel that listing on the ASX is timely, therefore, to enable a more favourable valuation of the company and its assets,” says Atlantic chairperson Neil Herbert.
