Aim-listed Panthera Resources has started an induced polarisation (IP) survey at its Bido project in Burkina Faso. The survey will cover the higher-priority targets that are accessible before the onset of the wet season in the third quarter. The Bido project comprises multiple gold prospects over the licence area, including extensive recent and historical artisanal workings, and targets identified by previous drilling. The survey will build on Panthera’s understanding of the geological and geochemical framework of the entire area and is aimed at prioritising drilling activity planned for later in the year. “The Bido project has existed in the shadow of Labola and Bassala for some time. It is the next step in the company's value creation chain as we advance our portfolio of opportunities in West Africa. “Bido is a large licence with a plethora of mineralised targets that require prioritisation ahead of drilling.  The IP programme, which is expected to be completed in coming weeks, is the final step ahead of planned drilling later in 2022,” says MD Mark Bolton. The company has contracted Sagax Afrique SA to conduct a gradient array IP survey over several grids in the Bido licence area. Panthera believes the geophysical technique will better define targets for drilling to be started after the wet period when combined with its geochemical and geological understanding of the area.
