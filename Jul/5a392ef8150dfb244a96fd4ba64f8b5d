Aim-listed Botswana Diamonds has launched a drill programme at its Thorny River project, in South Africa’s Limpopo province. The programme comprises at least ten reverse circulation (RC) drill holes and will investigate recently discovered high-grade geophysical anomalies and discover additional blows on the property. The drilling is earmarked to take two weeks and marks an important step in Botswana Diamonds’ drive to establish a commercial operation at Thorny River.
