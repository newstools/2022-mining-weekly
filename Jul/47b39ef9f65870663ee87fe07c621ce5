Aim-listed Cora Gold has completed and formally submitted its environmental- and social-impact assessment (ESIA) for its flagship Sanankoro gold project, in Mali, to the authorities for approval. The ESIA was completed by environmental consultants Digby Wells Environmental in alignment with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards. Formal submission of the ESIA was made to the Direction Nationale de l'Assainissement et du Contrôle des Pollutions et des Nuisances – the governing administration for environmental matters in Mali. Cora points out that the ESIA is a crucial component of the definitive feasibility study (DFS), which is expected to be completed in the third quarter. “The completion and submission of the ESIA marks a significant milestone for Cora as we continue to advance the development of our Sanankoro project towards production. “This, together with the recent completion of our 2022 drill programme that will be used to inform an updated mineral resource estimate, mark the next key objectives towards delivering our DFS,” says CEO Bert Monro. He notes that the ESIA work programme comprised multiple workstreams, including stakeholder engagement, specialist baseline and impact assessment studies (including biodiversity, water and social studies), an integrated environmental and social management programme, a conceptual closure and rehabilitation plan, a resettlement policy framework and a community development plan. “The ESIA, completed in accordance with Malian requirements for environmental permitting and in alignment with good international industry practice including the IFC Performance Standards, upholds Cora's commitment to excellence and working with our host communities to ensure an optimum outcome for all our stakeholders for the development of the Sanankoro gold project,” Monro says.
