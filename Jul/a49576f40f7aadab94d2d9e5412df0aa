Diversified major Anglo American has produced first copper concentrate from its Peru-based Quellaveco project, which is nearing completion ahead of receiving final regulatory clearance for commercial operations to start. Project development lead Tom McCulley says first copper production at Quellaveco is a key milestone in Anglo American’s delivery of the asset, on time and on budget. “The fact that we are today producing copper less than four years after project approval, including through two years of considerable pandemic-related disruption, is testament to the strength of our commitment to our workforce, local communities, the Moquegua region and government stakeholders in Peru.” He adds that this first production of copper concentrate marks the beginning of the normal period of testing the processing plant with ore and the ramping up of mining activities to demonstrate readiness for operations. Anglo American Peru CEO Adolfo Heere says that once Quellaveco reaches full operation, the project will increase Peru’s copper production by about 10%, and deliver sustainable benefits for decades, including 2 500 direct jobs. The project will also incorporate local suppliers into Anglo American’s supply chain, increase water sources for human consumption and irrigation, provide digital connectivity, and expand agricultural areas and tax revenues. “By working together in partnership, we will deliver enduring positive outcomes for all our stakeholders,” he says.
