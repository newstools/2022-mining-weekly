Quebec-based nickel mining complex Raglan Mine has tabled a new offer to the United Steelworkers Union (USU) for the renewal of their collective agreement. The offer follows the union’s decision to break off discussions and leave the negotiating table on July 7. The Glencore subsidiary explains that the new offer amends the global offer presented to USU on May 5, and serves to be more competitive and mutually beneficial, reportedly offering the Raglan Mine employees the best working conditions in the industry. “We have evidently not been able to find common ground with the union representatives, but we sincerely hope that this offer can put an end to the labour dispute as quickly as possible,” says Raglan Mine VP Pierre Barrette. Raglan employees affiliated with USU, Local 9449, have been on strike since May 27, which has had negative economical implications for the communities of Nunavik and Abitibi-Témiscamingue.
