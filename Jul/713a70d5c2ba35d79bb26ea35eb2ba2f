PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed White Rock Minerals remains on track to start initial gold production at its Morning Star gold mine, in Victoria, by the third quarter of this year. The company on Tuesday said that pre-production activities at the mine have started to access potential high-grade gold-bearing reefs, while the 80 000 t/y processing plant was being readied with pre-production commissioning about to start. “The team onsite has done a fantastic job to manage the drilling programme at the mine. We have already been able to identify up to five potential mining areas above 9 Level, despite some 500 000 oz having already been produced from this area,” said White Rock MD and CEO Matt Gill. “These drill results give us a high level of confidence that the existing Morning Star gold mine has the potential to develop into a whole new gold mining operation. “The success of the drilling to date and our own geological modelling and interpretation have given us the confidence to ramp up activities onsite. These activities have included the recruit of more personnel, ordering new equipment, commencing access development to some of these mining areas and readying the processing plant in order to produce our first gold in the next few months. This is an exciting time for everyone at White Rock.”
