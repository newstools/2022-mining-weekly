London-listed Pensana has received certification from CICERO Shades of Green, an independent, internationally recognised provider of assessments on green bond frameworks. CICERO is Norway’s institute for interdisciplinary climate research. It is independent of the financial and corporate sectors. CICERO has rated Pensana as operating in line with its principles, based on the company’s plans to create a sustainable magnet metal supply chain through a rare earth processing facility at the Saltend Chemicals Park, in the Humber Freeport, in the UK, and a mining operation in Angola. CICERO has also rated Pensana’s operations as ‘light green’ with a governance score of ‘good’. The rating refers to transition activities and projects that reduce emissions or provide other environmental benefits. “From the outset, the Pensana team has set out to develop an independent and sustainable magnet metal supply chain and it is extremely gratifying to receive a positive rating from an internationally recognised assessment agency of CICERO’s standing. “The CICERO certification supports our ambition to establish in the UK world-class production of the critical magnet metals vital to the electric vehicle and offshore wind industries,” says Pensana chairperson Paul Atherley. He outlines that the company’s aim is to produce ultralow-carbon magnet metal powered by private wire link to offshore wind at Saltend, supplied with high-value feedstock from its Longonjo mine, in Angola, powered by hydroelectricity. “The CICERO assessment will be important for the proposed green bond issuance as it will broaden the range of institutional investors interested in the offering,” Atherley notes.
