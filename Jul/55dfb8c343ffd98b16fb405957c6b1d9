Coal miner Liberty Coal has kicked off its Nelson Mandela month campaign at a community social investment (CSI) initiative in its host community of Hendrina, Mpumalanga. The CSI initiative is aimed at empowering the immediate Hendrina community, with a particular focus on the youth, with skills and advantages that will put them in good stead in the job market, the company says. It forms part of Liberty Coal’s ongoing commitment to conduct sustainable mining operations that benefit the Optimum coal mine’s host communities to make a difference in the fight against unemployment, the company notes. The key driver of this initiative will see 20 beneficiaries participate in a Code 10 and Code 14 drivers’ licence programme, which will allow them to drive any vehicle weighing up to 16 000 kg with a trailer of up to 750 kg. Another 20 community members will undertake an articulated dump truck operator training programme. Moreover, 100 school uniforms will be provided to those in need. July is widely known as the birth month of late former President Nelson Mandela. In celebration and recognition of this, Liberty Coal will be unveiling its planned commemoration of his life, which calls on all South Africans to give 67 minutes of their time towards making a difference.
