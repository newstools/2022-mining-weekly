PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has welcomed the decision by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) to lift sanctions against Mali, where it operates the Syama gold mine. Sanctions were imposed on Mali in January this year after the military government said it would not organise elections the following month, as initially planned. The interim government has now proposed a 24-month transition to democracy and has published a new electoral law, prompting Ecowas to lift sanctions immediately. Reports by Al Jazeera suggested that the sanctions imposed by Ecowas, had raised humanitarian concerns and has seen Mali default on more than $300-million of its debt as the country was cut off from regional financial markets and the regional central bank.
