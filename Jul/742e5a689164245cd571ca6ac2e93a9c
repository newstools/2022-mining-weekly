Canadian miner Asante Gold has poured first gold at its Bibiani gold mine, in Ghana. The company acquired the mine in August last year and has since been refurbishing and upgrading a Knelson concentrator and other processing equipment, a tailings storage facility and mine site infrastructure. The Bibiani processing plant was commissioned early in June, while 24-hour daily operation started on July 1, including carbon-in-leach, carbon stripping and elution areas now operating. The company plans on further scaling up operations to achieve a 175 000 oz/y capacity. CEO Dave Anthony explains that from the outset of the acquisition, Asante set out to deliver on commitments to stakeholders, which is evident in the teams’ quality and timeliness of work.
