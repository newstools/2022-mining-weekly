TSX-V-listed GoviEx Uranium will enjoy a 50% tax deferral on its 80%-owned Madaouela project’s surface area taxes due later this month. The government of Niger, which owns 20% of the project, has agreed to GoviEx paying $2.8-million in taxes in July and the other $2.8-million in December. The company has welcomed the deferment and says it is glad to have a good partner in the government of Niger. Meanwhile, a feasibility study on the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter and represents another step toward the project becoming a uranium-producing asset.
