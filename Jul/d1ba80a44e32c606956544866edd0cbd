Dual-listed Jubilee Metals Group expects its Sable copper and cobalt refinery, in Zambia, to start commercial production in August. The cobalt refining circuit entered the commissioning phase in June, as expected. The cobalt refining circuit at Sable is able to produce up to 1 200 t/y of cobalt, depending on the feed grade. Jubilee is integrating the Sable refinery with its newly built Project Roan copper concentrator as part of its Southern Refining strategy to produce 12 000 t/y of copper. Commissioning and ramp-up at the Project Roan concentrator are continuing and it has reached 65% of design capacity. The concentrator is expected to reach full design capacity by the end of this month. At capacity, it will process about 830 t a month of copper in concentrate for refining at Sable. Jubilee says considerable employment opportunities have been created and local suppliers prioritised, to create a locally sustainable support infrastructure. “Reaching these significant milestones . . . put us in great stead for the financial year ahead, and beyond. It is testament to all the hard work by the Jubilee team that, over the past 12 months, [we] have delivered on a bold implementation plan across the platinum group metal (PGM) and chrome operations in South Africa and the copper and cobalt operations in Zambia. “During this period, we delivered a new and upgraded Inyoni PGMs facility to reach 45 000 oz/y of PGMs. [The facility] includes a newly constructed and fully integrated 80 000 t a month chrome beneficiation circuit. The circuit was further complemented with the inclusion of Jubilee’s renowned ultrafine chrome circuit earlier this year,” CEO Leon Coetzer comments.
