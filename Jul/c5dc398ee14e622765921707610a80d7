Nickel exploration company Resource Mining Corporation (RMC) has completed the maiden reverse circulation drilling programme at its Tanzania-based Kabulwanyele project. The completed programme comprised 19 holes for a total of 799 m drilled, testing the depth extents of the nickel laterite, indicating a saprolite profile present consistently throughout the project area. The thickness of the ferruginous layer combined with saprolite (highly weathered rocks) and saprolitic rock (moderately weathered rocks) layers ranges between 5 m and 50 m. Fresh rock was also sampled. Collected samples will be prepared at the Nesch Mintek laboratory in Mwanza and shipped to ALS Chemex in South Africa for analysis. The assay results are expected in the next two months. Going forward, RMC will undertake a gravity survey, followed potentially by electromagnetic surveys to define the size and extent of the mafic–ultramafic inlier at Kabulwanyele, and aid in the definition of other forms of nickel mineralisation there. RMC executive chairperson Asimwe Kabunga says the company’s Tanzanian in-country team completed the programme on time and on budget.
