US silver major Hecla has delivered a solid performance at its three operating mines during the second quarter, with a quarter-on-quarter increase in silver, gold, lead and zinc production. Silver output jumped from 3.3-million ounces in the first quarter, to 3.6-million ounces in the second quarter, driven by higher production at Lucky Friday, in Idaho, where the company is employing a new mining method. Lucky Friday’s silver production surpassed the one-million-ounce mark for the quarter, totalling 1.2-million ounces, a 38% increase over the previous quarter. President and CEO Philips Baker attributed the stronger production performance to the benefits of the underhand closed bench mining method, which Hecla developed to control fault-slip seismicity in deep, high-stress, narrow-vein mining, as well as increasing grades. The mill at Lucky Friday operated at a record average throughput rate of 1 071 t/d for the quarter, highlighted by a record monthly throughput in June of 1 120 t/d. At Greens Creek, in Alaska, Hecla produced 2.4-million ounces of silver, which is consistent with production in the first quarter. Gold production was 9% higher at 12 413 oz. At Casa Berardi, in Quebec, gold production increased to 33 306 oz, compared with 30 340 oz in the prior quarter. Hecla earlier this month announced the acquisition of Alexco Resources, which owns the Keno Hill silver district in Yukon, Canada. The addition of Keno Hill has the potential to make the company the biggest silver producer in Canada.
