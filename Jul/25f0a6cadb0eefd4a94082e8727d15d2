Canadian diversified miner Teck Resources has achieved its second-quarter steelmaking coal sales guidance, with output of 6.3-million tonnes. The group’s previously announced guidance was 6.3-million to 6.7-million tonnes. Record steelmaking free-on-board prices resulted in an increase in average realised prices to $453/t, Teck reported on Thursday. The miner said it would report a provisional pricing adjustment of negative $73-million for the quarter, owing to a decline in coal prices at quarter-end. Prices are declining on the back of a weak steel market outlook as construction looks set to slow. China is grappling with revitalising its economy in the wake of Covid-19 lockdowns.
