TSX-V-listed Canada Nickel Company has more than doubled the measured and indicated mineral resources of its Crawford nickel sulphide project, in Ontario, to 1.43-billion tonnes grading 0.24% nickel. The updated mineral resource estimate (MRE) for the project, which was published on July 6, was driven in large part by outstanding exploration success in the East Zone area of the project. The inferred resource stands at 670-milllion tonnes grading 0.23% nickel. The measured and indicated resources also include 93-million tonnes of iron, 8.5-million tonnes of chromium, 183 000 t of cobalt and about 1-million ounces of palladium and platinum. Crawford is quickly becoming one of the biggest nickel sulphide resources globally, says CEO and chairperson Mark Selby, explaining that the latest MRE was informed by 56 286 m of drilling across 113 drill holes during 2021 and early this year. When combined with the potential for zero carbon production, the Crawford project is expected to become an important source of nickel for electric vehicle and stainless-steel producers. With additional potential from a number of holes still pending assays at the resource cut-off date, Canada Nickel expects the final feasibility study resource to support the upper end of its mine plan target of producing 1.3- to 1.8-billion tonnes. The Crawford feasibility study is said to be on track for completion by the end of the year. Selby mentions that the feasibility study will incorporate resources for the North Zone and Western Extension, totalling 53 holes combined, and is expected to be completed later this year.
