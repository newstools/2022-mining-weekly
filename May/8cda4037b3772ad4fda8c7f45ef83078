PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Laneway Resources has been granted environmental clearance to start processing Agate Creek ore at its Georgetown processing plant, in North Queensland. Laneway earlier this year acquired the Georgetown gold processing plant, along with an extensive portfolio of mining and exploration tenements, from Masterson Minerals. The company subsequently started refurbishment activities at the project. Laneway told shareholders on Tuesday that with the amended Environmental Authority for the plant now in place, high grade oxide ore from the Agate Creek project is now permitted to be treated through the Georgetown processing plant representing achievement of another significant milestone and providing Laneway with a clear path to the commencement of processing ore. The next phase of drilling and blasting of ore at Agate Creek is expected to commence next week with earthmovers to mobilise soon after. The restart of the Georgetown gold processing plant will enable Laneway to take control over its gold production future, generate material free cashflow and begin building the platform for a regional gold processing centre, the company told shareholders. “We are pleased with the rapid progress being made towards the restart of the Georgetown plant which will enable us to take control of our processing and development future and provide a clear pathway for Laneway to execute on its significant growth pipeline,” said MD Brad Gordon.
