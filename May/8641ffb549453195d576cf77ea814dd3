Base and precious metals miner Atico Mining Corporation has received approval of the environmental-impact assessment (EIA) for the construction and operation of its La Plata mining project in Ecuador. The company notes that the project has been identified by Ecuador President Guillermo Lasso as a strategic project and a component of the country’s reactivation plan. As a part of this plan, Lasso has committed to accelerating the restart of the country’s economy by leveraging the potential of its mining industry, while positioning Ecuador as a major mining investment destination in Latin America. “Our team is very pleased to announce the receipt of the EIA approval for the La Plata project. This announcement is the culmination of a lengthy scientific process to identify every aspect of the project that could be optimised and provide solutions allowing for a responsible mining operation. We also wish to acknowledge the extensive efforts of our employees, consultants, surrounding communities and the support from the Ecuadorian environmental authorities,” comments Atico president Alain Bureau. The EIA baseline process started years ago and involved independent environmental experts, as well as qualified professionals from Ecuador, Canada and Peru, as well as from Atico's El Roble mine operation in Colombia. The La Plata project plan consists of a 900 t/d underground mining operation with state-of-the-art infrastructure, the most significant infrastructure being the construction of a filtered tailings facility – the first of its kind in Ecuador. This technology, already used at the El Roble mine, allows for efficient use of water by significantly reducing water consumption through recirculating almost all of the water needs for the processing plant.
