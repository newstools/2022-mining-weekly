TSX-V-listed Critical Elements Lithium has successfully produced battery-grade lithium hydroxide in a pilot plant programme, converting spodumene concentrate from the Rose project, in Quebec, into battery grade lithium hydroxide using a thermal leaching process. The pilot plant conversion process from spodumene concentrate to lithium hydroxide was further optimised and confirmed the previous results with extraction and conversion rates of 92%.  In addition, the pilot plant produced battery-grade lithium hydroxide. The pilot plant work programme was conducted at technology group Metso’s Outotec Research Center in Finland. Following this successful lithium hydroxide process optimisation campaign, Critical Elements will finalise its feasibility study for a lithium hydroxide conversion facility.
