Canadian mining executive Kelly Stark-Anderson has been appointed to the board of Mountain Province Diamonds, following the departure of Dean Chambers, who has chosen to step down owing to other commitments. Stark-Anderson has more than 25 years’ experience in the legal, merger and acquisition, financing and governance areas, combined with experience in environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. “Her legal expertise and strong ESG experience are areas we were seeking to strengthen on our board, which together with her extensive governance experience will be extremely beneficial as the company advances through 2022 and beyond,” says chairperson Jonathan Comerford. Stark-Anderson is currently executive VP for corporate affairs for Dundee Precious Metals and was formerly at SSR Mining.
