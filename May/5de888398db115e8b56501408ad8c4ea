ASX- and Aim-listed Sovereign Metals has taken what it deems proactive steps to establish an environment, social and governance (ESG) framework poised to position it as an industry leader on corporate social responsibility in Malawi, where it is developing the Kasiya rutile project. MD Dr Julian Stephens says Sovereign has worked hard to maintain a strong and positive social licence to operate in Malawi over the last decade. Sovereign has identified four schools in the neighbouring community of Kasiya, under its Schools Upgrade Programme, which would significantly benefit from access to additional learning materials and upgrades to their learning environments. The company has also established a scholarship programme, which will provide high school learners with support to reach their full potential – an initial eight students have entered the scholarship programme. Sovereign regularly provides internships for students from the University of Malawi, and has accepted 12 students to assist in an upcoming drill programme with six geology and six engineering students gaining experience and exposure to the industry. The company also frequently assists the local community through infrastructure builds, including a new community centre and water bore across the company’s licence area to provide communities with drinking water. Meanwhile, Sovereign is working to complete an updated scoping study on the project in the next few weeks.
