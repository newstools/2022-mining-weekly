PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company has recovered a 204 ct white diamond at its Mothae mine, in Lesotho. The diamond was the eighth stone of more than 100 ct recovered at Mothae, and the third of more than 200 ct, since the mine started commercial operations in 2019. Lucapa last year completed an expansion project at the kimberlite mine, which increased the nameplate capacity at Mothae by 45%, from 1.1-million tonnes a year to around 1.6-million tonnes a year.
