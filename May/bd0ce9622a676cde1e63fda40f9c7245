PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Talga has reported a 54% increase in the resource estimate for its Vittangi graphite project, in Sweden, adding more than 10-million tonnes to Europe’s largest graphite resource. The Vittangi project is now estimated to host a mineral resource of 30.1-million tonnes of graphite ore, at 24.1% carbon in graphite. The new mineral resource estimate included a maiden mineral resource for the Nunasvaara East discovery, while the Vittangi deposit remains open along strike and at depth, with Talga planning further drilling to underpin the continued growth at the resource. “Currently, there is more than 960 GWh of lithium-ion battery capacity using graphite anode technology planned in Europe. In boosting our graphite mineral resource, we are also boosting our ability to supply sustainable anode products and setting Talga up to become a major supplier to the world’s fastest-growing lithium-ion battery markets,” said Talga MD Mark Thompson. Talga is building a vertically integrated graphite anode business in Europe using 100% renewable electricity to produce ultra-low-emissions coated active anode for greener lithium-ion batteries. The company is progressing towards commercial production at its flagship active anode material plant, having recently opened the first lithium-ion battery anode plant in Europe, and reaching a milestone in the permitting process for the 19 500 t/y operation.
