PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Iron Road will undertake a market sounding process to gauge commercial interest in the proposed Cape Hardy green hydrogen and industrial precinct. The South Australian government has previously identified Cape Hardy as one of three hubs for green hydrogen production, liquefaction or conversion, water desalination, storage and export, and has selected seven short-listed projects for converting the State-owned site at Port Bonython, in the Upper Spencer Gulf, into an export hub for green and blue hydrogen. Iron Road is preparing an expression of interest process targeting Australian and international green hydrogen project proponents for its 100%-owned site at Cape Hardy, and is expected to launch this process in the second half of 2022. The company on Wednesday said that it has now employed WSP Australia to undertake market sounding to determine commercial interest in the precinct. Iron Road has primary development approval for the port site as a high-grade iron concentrate and multi-commodity export facility, while its own Central Eyre Iron project (CEIP), including the proposed logistics chain, could ultimately provide offtake for hydrogen and derivative products. In addition, value-adding opportunities such as green pellet production would also benefit from a longer-term hydrogen development at Cape Hardy, the company said. Iron Road said on Wednesday that the company’s focus continues to centre on CEIP engagement with potential strategic partners, and evaluating proposals that offer shareholders value with respect to the quality of the company’s asset base.
