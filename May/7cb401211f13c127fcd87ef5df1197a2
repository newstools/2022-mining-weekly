Aim-listed gold producer Goldplat nonexecutive chairperson Matthew Robinson has informed the company of his intention to resign as a director. He has notified the company that he would remain in his role until the next annual general meeting (AGM) to allow reasonable time for Goldplat to make appropriate alternative arrangements and ensure a smooth transition. "Since my appointment as a director and [chairperson] at the 2016 AGM, Goldplat has undertaken a transformation of strategy which has now been completed,” Robinson said. He added that Goldplat was now profitable and well financed and that it had been returning cash to shareholders through a share buyback programme. Moreover, Robinson believed the company was performing well in terms of environment, social and governance standards. "Management have many . . . initiatives for taking the group forward and this provides a solid platform for future shareholder returns," Robinson said. Goldplat said it would now review its governance requirements, including board composition and the balance of independent nonexecutive directors.
