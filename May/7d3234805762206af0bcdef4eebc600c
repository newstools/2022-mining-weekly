Gold miner AngloGold Ashanti has been approved for a secondary listing on A2X, where its shares will be available for trade from June 6. AngloGold said on May 30 that it believed the A2X listing would allow a new, competitively priced, alternative platform for investors to trade shares of the company. The gold miner will retain its listings on the JSE, the NYSE, the ASE and the GSE. AngloGold Ashanti’s issued share capital will be unaffected by the additional listing on A2X, which is a licensed stock exchange authorised to provide a secondary listing venue for companies. The A2X is regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority and Prudential Authority, which fall under the South African Reserve Bank in terms of the Financial Markets Act. A2X has listings from several other key sectors, including media, banking, retail, fast-moving consumer goods, financial services, insurance, healthcare and telecommunications.
