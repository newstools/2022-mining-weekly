Toronto-listed Monarch Mining has appointed Renaud Adams – former CEO of New Gold – to its board of directors, replacing Christian Pichette, who is retiring from his position as director. Welcoming Adams to Monarch’s board, chairperson Michel Bouchard said on Monday that the company was delighted to have someone of the caliber of Adams join its board. “Adams has a long record of achievements in the mining industry, including the sale of Richmont Mines to Alamos Gold. In addition to his strong mining engineering technical skills, Adams has a strong grasp of the financial markets, having served in executive management positions with major mining companies for the past 15 years, including as CEO for New Gold and for Richmont Mines, the previous owner of the Beaufor mine,” said Bouchard. Monarch currently owns the Beaufor mine, which has produced more than one-million ounces of gold over the last 30 years. The company is aiming to restart operations.
