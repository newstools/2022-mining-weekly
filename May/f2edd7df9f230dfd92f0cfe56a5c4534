PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX- and JSE-listed DRA Global on Thursday announced that its CFO Adam Buckler was no longer employed with the company. GM for corporate finance, Michael Sucher will now assume the role of acting CFO while the company undertakes a management search to fill the role on a permanent basis. DRA earlier this week warned shareholders of lower revenue and earnings for the 2022 financial year, with the company launching an optimisation review of its business portfolio, operating model and cost structure, on order to optimise shareholder value. The Australian Takeovers Panel is currently considering orders against DRA, after this week declaring unacceptable circumstances around the actions of certain DRA management and board members.
