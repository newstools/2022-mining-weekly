Exploration and development company US Gold cofounder Luke Norman has been appointed chairperson of the company, following a board resolution to increase its size from five to six members. George Bee, who has held the chairperson position since March 2021, will remain as president and CEO of US Gold. Norman has more than 20 years of experience in the venture capital markets.  He has raised more than $300-million for both public and private companies, predominantly in the resource space. In recent years, he has operated a consultancy company to the metals and mining industry.  He co-founded Gold Standard Ventures, a TSX- and NYSE-listed gold exploration and development company. Norman is the co-founder of US Gold, chairperson of TSX-V-listed Silver One Resources, and CEO of TSX-V-listed Leviathan Gold. “I have been very close to the company since its merger with Dataram Corporation, both as a co-founder and as a significant investor.  I have invested millions of dollars of my own personal capital into US Gold and continue to believe there is a massive valuation disconnect between the incredible projects we have and our current public valuation,” said Norman. “This is an exciting time in the markets, with the price of gold and copper pushing towards all-time highs. Producing American gold and copper in mining-friendly Wyoming and having the potential to create hundreds of high-quality local jobs is an exciting story to be a part of." Commenting on the changes, Bee said, "Luke is a welcome addition to the board and provides outstanding capital markets experience at a time when the CK Gold project is rapidly advancing toward a ‘shovel-ready’ project. The prefeasibility study announced on December 1, 2021, shows a robust and attractive economic proposition that needs to be financed in anticipation of our permit approval in 2023.”
