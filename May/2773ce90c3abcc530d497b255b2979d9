The Gramalote gold project, in Antioquia, Colombia, continues to enjoy strong federal and local government support, as well as continuing support from local communities, Canada-based B2Gold said on Tuesday. The company owns Gramalote in a joint venture with AngloGold Ashanti, which last week was dealt a fresh blow at its Quebradona copper project, in Antioquia, after environmental regulator denied a request to appeal against the shelving of its permit application. B2Gold reported that it was busy completing the feasibility study work for Gramalote and that results of the final feasibility study would be available by the end of the second quarter. A decision to develop Gramalote as an openpit gold mine was now expected by the end of the third quarter, B2Gold said. B2Gold initially planned to complete the Gramalote feasibility study by April 2021, with a construction decision to be made shortly thereafter.
