Aim-listed Atlantic Lithium has mobilised three additional drill rigs at the Ewoyaa lithium project, in Ghana, including a diamond core drill rig that is due to arrive on site soon. To date, 9 166 m of reverse circulation drilling have been completed, with assays pending for 52 holes. In the meantime, Atlantic has observed multiple and significant visual spodumene pegmatite drill intercepts of up to 80 m long. Results are also pending for an airborne geophysical survey and grid soil geochemical survey, which took place over the Cape Coast licence area. The company will soon have four drill rigs operating on site, which will cater for an expanded drill programme. Atlantic has announced that it is extending the drill programme from 19 000 m previously to 37 000 m, involving exploration, resource extension, resource infill and geotechnical drilling. The company wants to test new targets defined in auger drilling within the Ewoyaa pegmatite corridor, to the north and south of the current mineral resource estimate (MRE) area, as well as convert the resources to “measured”. As it stands, the MRE totals 30-million tonnes grading 1.26% lithium oxide. Atlantic confirms that regional exploration auger drilling is ongoing over the Mankessim and Saltond licences. The company is on track to deliver a prefeasibility study during the third quarter of the year.
