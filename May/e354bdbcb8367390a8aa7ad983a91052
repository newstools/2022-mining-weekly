PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Alkane Resources has poured its 500 000th ounce of gold at its Tomingley operation, in New South Wales. “Pouring our 500 000th ounce is a significant milestone that provides a fitting testament to the teams that have worked on the Tomingley gold project and operations since the days of discovery by Alkane in the early 2000s,” said MD Nic Earner on Wednesday. “When we commenced mining at Tomingley in 2013, the plan was to produce 380 000 oz from opencut and underground over seven years. We were also quietly confident that further discoveries would be made during that time to allow extension. “Here we are, nine years later, entering our second decade of production and passing 500 000 oz, proving that our confidence was well-founded. We have met or exceeded our production guidance every year of operation and surpassed our original production targets. We have expanded our resources around the existing mine and added new discoveries to the south of Tomingley. Our geological teams are seeking to expand these resources even further,” said Earner. He noted that the current life-of-mine plan for Tomingley showed 700 000 oz of planned production over the next decade. Between 2022 and 2023, the Tomingley mine is expected to produce 50 000 oz to 60 000 oz/y, with production increasing from 60 000 oz/y through to 2024, and would reach between 100 000 oz/y and 115 000 oz/y for 2025 to 2027. Production between 2028 and 2031 would reach between 55 000 oz/y and 65 000 oz/y.
