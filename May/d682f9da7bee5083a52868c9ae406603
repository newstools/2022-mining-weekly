Diamond miner Mountain Province has discovered kimberlite in three of four targets tested at its Kennady North project, which surrounds the Gahcho Kué mine, in Northwest Territories. The company is midstride a 6 000 m drill programme, with 3 000 m having been completed. "We began 2022 with a plan to launch an aggressive winter exploration campaign over Kennady North, and we have achieved that plan. We have discovered kimberlite in three of four targets tested to date, and completed all of our scheduled airborne and ground geophysics,” said president and CEO Mark Well. "In the final weeks of our winter programme, Mountain Province will continue to drill-test as many priority anomalies as feasible with the intent to discover more kimberlite and add value to the Kennady North project. "The winter 2022 programme will be wrapped up at the end of this month. Summer exploration will start in the third quarter, with emphasis on follow-up sampling of indicator mineral results generated from the 2021 till sampling programme, which will be complete by the end of the third quarter. “As a pure Canadian diamond producer and explorer, we see this as an important time to aggressively explore for new Canadian diamond production,” said Wall.
