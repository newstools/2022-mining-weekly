Gold miner Caledonia Mining Corporation, which operates the Blanket mine, in Zimbabwe, has appointed Gordon Wylie independent nonexecutive director, with immediate effect.

He holds a bachelor’s degree with honours in geology from the University of Glasgow, a management diploma from the University of South Africa and a Postgraduate Diploma in Mining Engineering and Mineral Economics from the University of the Witwatersrand, in South Africa. Caledonia chairperson Leigh Wilson says Wylie has broad and diverse experience in mining geology, as well as in corporate governance, compliance and capital markets on a variety of exchanges.

“As Caledonia continues to focus on new opportunities, we believe [his] exploration experience in emerging mining jurisdictions will be invaluable in contributing to the company's growth and development,” he adds.

Wylie has over 46 years’ experience in the mining industry in both mining and exploration geology. From 1997 to 2005, he was part of AngloGold Ashanti’s senior management team and responsible for the company’s global exploration programmes, mining geology and associated technical services, covering about 40 countries and five continents.

Since leaving AngloGold, he accumulated 16 years’ board experience as a nonexecutive director, of which 12 were as chairperson of Lydian International. Wylie is currently a nonexecutive director of Aim-listed Chaarat Gold, and a nonexecutive director of TSX-V-listed Silverton Metals.

Wylie says Caledonia has a strong record of navigating the complexities of operating in Zimbabwe and delivering on its word with the successful commissioning of the Central Shaft and the associated ramp-up in production. “I look forward to being part of Caledonia's board and working with the team to support its continued growth strategy.”
