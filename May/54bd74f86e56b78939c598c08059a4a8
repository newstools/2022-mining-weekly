Grindrod’s Matola terminal at the Port of Maputo says it has welcomed its second coal train from Botswana. The terminal also managed to successfully discharge the 50 wagons using the terminal’s tipplers. The first train arrived at the port in April, marking a milestone for Grindrod’s Mozambican drybulk terminal. This rail consignment of 40 wagons each carried around 2 000 t of mineral coal. The train originated from Palapye, in Botswana, transiting through Zimbabwe via the Chicualacuala rail network, to the final destination in Maputo. Grindrod loaded the cargo on a vessel destined for Europe. This follows the dispatch of a sample load to the Matola terminal, in order to confirm the compatibility of the Botswana wagons with the terminal’s tipplers. This successful collaboration between African Railway Company, Botswana Rail, National Railways of Zimbabwe, Mozambican Railway Company (Caminhos de Ferro de Moçambique) and Grindrod, has managed to create a new export route for Botswana coal producers. It is envisaged that the corridor could realise a yearly export volume of 350 000 t to 400 000 t of coal from Botswana. Botswana is attempting to develop a number of new coal mines, but as it is a landlocked country it requires a cost-effective, efficient crossborder export route.
