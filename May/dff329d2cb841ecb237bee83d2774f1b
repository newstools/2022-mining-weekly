Matthew Glowasky has resigned as nonexecutive director of Petra Diamonds, with immediate effect. Glowasky was appointed as a non-independent, nonexecutive director of the company on March 10, pursuant to a nomination agreement between the company and Monarch Master Funding 2 and following the successful completion of the recapitalisation of Petra. While Monarch does not currently intend to nominate a director to replace Glowasky, it retains its right to do so under the nomination agreement. “On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Matthew for his contribution to Petra during his tenure as a director and wish him every success in his future endeavours,” says Petra nonexecutive chairperson Peter Hill.
