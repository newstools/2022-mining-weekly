Aim- and BSE-listed Botswana Diamonds’ ground geophysics survey on its Sekaka diamond prospecting licences, in Botswana, has revealed high-interest anomalies indicative of kimberlite pipes discovered in the vicinity of the KX36 diamond discovery. “These results strongly support our view that other kimberlites remain to be found in the vicinity of our 100%-owned KX36 diamond discovery. “If these anomalies prove to be diamondiferous kimberlites, it will enhance the commercial prospects of the existing KX36 discovery. We will now do follow-up work to target drill sites,” says chairperson John Teeling. Following a detailed review of aeromagnetic data on Sekaka licences PL069/2019 and PL224/2007 four high-interest anomalies were identified within a 6 km radius of the existing KX36 discovery in the Central Kalahari of Botswana. The anomalies are magnetic highs along fault structures and are typical of occurrences of kimberlite pipes in the area. A recent ground follow-up work with ground magnetic surveys confirmed these encouraging anomalies. The nest steps are gravity modelling and soil sampling. A drill programme will be put in place.
