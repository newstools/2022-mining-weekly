The Northern Cape stands to benefit to the tune of R10-billion when Phase 2 of the Vaal Gamagara Water Supply Scheme (VGWSS) is implemented, Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu has announced. The construction of the bulk water supply project is critical to both the mining sector and communities of the Northern Cape. The project involves the construction of a bulk pipeline from the Vaal river to Hotazel, including reticulation to communities located along the pipeline.

Mchunu this week revealed that R1.4-billion had already been spent on Phase 1 of the VGWSS, which is 96% complete. The project is being implemented in a partnership between government and mining houses in the Northern Cape, with the mining houses contributing about half of the funds for the project.
