PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Kairos Minerals has launched a strategic review of the company’s minerals project portfolio and costs across the board. The strategic review, which will be done with the assistance of an independent third party, will assess the company’s Pilbara lithium and gold assets as well as the Roe Hill project to determine the best avenues for maximising shareholder value. The review will consider further exploration, on-boarding strategic or cornerstone partners, joint venture arrangements, assets sales or asset spin-offs, Kairos told shareholders. To assist in this review, the company has engaged Corporate & Resource Consultants (CRC) for a period of six months. CRC will also assist Kairos in the identification and recruitment of suitable management who have technical expertise in the lithium and gold sectors.
