PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX- and TSX-listed battery metals company Jervois remains on track to start first ore processing at its Idaho Cobalt Operations (ICO), in the US, in the third quarter of this year. Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting, nonexecutive chairperson Peter Johnston told shareholders that construction at the ICO project continued, and full production would be reached in December. Jervois last year approved $92.6-million capital for construction of the mine and process facility. The operation will comprise of a 1 200 t/d mill and concentrator to produce separated cobalt and copper concentrates. Gold mineralisation in the reserve at ICO will be reported to the cobalt concentrate, and will be recovered at the São Miguel Paulista refinery, in Brazil, subject to Jervois completing the acquisition and restart of the refinery in stages during 2022 and 2023. “We’ve recently commenced the underground drill programme at ICO to enhance the resource model, to optimise initial mining, and to target resource expansion. Our resource expansion drill programmes will be important to enable Jervois to evaluate options to both extend mine life and increase production levels beyond that contained in the initial bankable feasibility study,” said Johnston. “The current deposit at ICO remains open at depth and along strike and we are confident in the growth potential of the mineral reserves and resources.” Meanwhile, Johnston noted that Jervois was continuing with the acquisition of the São Miguel Paulista refinery.
