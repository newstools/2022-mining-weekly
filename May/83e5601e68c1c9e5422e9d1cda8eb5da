Aim-listed Cora Gold has received the second set of drill results from its recently completed 2022 drill programme at its Sanankoro gold project, in southern Mali, and CEO Bert Monro says the latest results from Zone B North once again show shallow oxide mineralisation of good widths and grade. Reverse circulation (RC) drilling highlights from Zone B North include 17 m at 2.85 g/t gold from 81 m in hole SC0616, which Monro says is a very positive drill hole as Cora targets upgrading the Zone B North deposit to indicated resources. “We look forward to releasing the results from the final phase of the programme, which focussed on Selin and follow-up holes at the new discoveries at Fode 1 and Target 6, in the coming weeks,” he adds. All Zone B North RC holes have now been released and RC assay results from Selin, Fode 1 and Target 6 will be released in the coming weeks. The drill programme consisted of 11 aircore shallow holes for 897 m and 78 RC holes for a total of 6 992 m. Drilling was aimed at converting existing inferred mineral resources to indicated mineral resources, as well as at identifying new discoveries at Sanankoro.
