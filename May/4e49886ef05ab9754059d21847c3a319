PERTH (miningweekly.com) – On-going skills and labour shortages have forced ASX-listed OreCorp to push back the timeline for the definitive feasibility study (DFS) for its Nyanzaga gold project, in Tanzania. The company in October last year told shareholders that the completion date for the DFS was targeted for the end of the second quarter of 2022, with front-end engineering design targeted for the fourth quarter of this year, and breaking ground for the second quarter of 2023. However, the gold developer on Thursday told shareholders that completion of the DFS had now been pushed back until the third quarter of 2022. Project construction is now targeted to start in the third quarter of 2023, with first production due in the first quarter of 2025. The Nyanzaga project is expected to produce 213 000 oz/y over a mine life of 12 years, with OreCorp expected to invest $287-million to bring the project into production.
