Gold junior Abcourt Mines on Monday announced that it would cease operations at the Elder mine, near Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, stating that the mine had become “less and less profitable despite the efforts of all employees”. The corporation said it would proceed with a collective dismissal on August 1. Several employees would be reassigned from the Elder mine to the Sleeping Giant mine. “I would like to thank the employees of the Elder mine, who have built and produced gold over the past ten years with all the effort it took. Unfortunately, some employees will be affected by this change, and we will do everything we can to help them reduce the impact,” said president and CEO Pascal Hamelin. He stated that 2023 would be a pivotal year for Abcourt, with the prioritising of the reopening of the Sleeping Giant mine. “We have a team ready to face the challenges and I have confidence that we will find the Giant.” The Sleeping Giant team has started the workings rehabilitation in the upper levels of the mine, and already identified new mineralized sectors. The objective is to accelerate the rehabilitation in many levels, and the shaft. At the same time, the geologists will be able to identify new mineralized zones with all the new technological tools at their disposal and the support of veterans of the exploration industry in Abitibi.
