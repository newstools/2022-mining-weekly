PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Calidus Resources has poured its first gold from its carbon-in-leach circuit at its Warrawoona gold project, in Western Australia. The first gold pour marked the successful completion of commissioning of the full processing circuit, with 33 kg of gold now having been poured. The process plant has achieved milling rates of 2.2-million tonnes a year, and a full ramp-up to 2.4-million tonnes a year is expected to be completed this quarter. “Commissioning of our processing plant was highly successful and is a tribute to the skills of our team. We are increasing throughput and gold output with the aim of reaching full production rates this quarter,” said Calidus MD Dave Reeves. “Over the remainder of the quarter, we will focus on our operational ramp-up and other site activities including our active exploration programmes that have taken place during the course of development.” Warrawoona is expected to produce up to 105 000 oz of gold a year, but could potentially produce up to 139 000 oz/y when the nearby Blue Spec deposit is developed.
