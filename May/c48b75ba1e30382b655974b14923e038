Eastinco Mining and Exploration, an exploration and development company with a portfolio of Africa-focused critical and strategic metal assets, has announced its intention to appoint gigaplant developer Britishvolt CIO Kasra Pezeshki to the board as a nonexecutive director of the company, which will take effect upon the admission of Eastinco to the main market of the LSE, which was announced in November last year. Britishvolt is developing the UK's first large-scale gigaplant, currently under construction in Northumberland. “[Pezeshki] joins Eastinco at an exciting time in our corporate development and his insight and experience in electrification and the green metal supply chain is closely aligned to our strategic objectives,” said Eastinco chairperson Charles Bray. Pezeshki has more than 17 years of experience in investment banking, structured finance, and private equity at institutions such as UBP, Morgan Stanley, Adveq, Bank of America and Enveq in London, New York, Geneva, and Zurich. As the cofounder and director of Enveq, Pezeshki has originated, structured and executed deals for a range of clients varying from corporates to family offices, as well as having made direct investments in venture capital and private equity. Enveq continues to manage and own a portfolio of investment companies active in healthcare, technology, entertainment and real estate, as well as being an early investor in Britishvolt. Pezeshki holds a BSc with honours from the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of the University of Hertfordshire and an MSc degree in computer science from Imperial College London. "We are actively working towards an expansion of our asset portfolio, which focuses on critical and strategically important green metals. We believe the underlying growth fundamentals for these green metals are driven by strong global demand for renewable and sustainable energy sources, the push towards electric vehicles and achieving a carbon-neutral society,” Bray said.
