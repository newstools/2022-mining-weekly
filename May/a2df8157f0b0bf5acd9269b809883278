PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed environmental technology company Calix has been awarded an A$11-million grant from the federal government’s Carbon Capture, Use and Storage Hubs and Technologies programme, to develop the world’s first commercial-scale process for low emissions lime. Patterning with ASX-listed Adbri, Calix will develop a low emissions lime kiln, located in Western Australia, to provide low emissions lime for the alumina, gold and other industries in the state. The plant will use Calix’s low emissions intensity lime and cement, or LEILAC, technology to demonstrate the use of renewable power and grid load balancing, assess alternative energy sources such as hydrogen, and the efficient capture of carbon process emissions. The captured carbon dioxide will be provided to the proposed South West Hub carbon capture and storage project.
