PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore major Fortescue Metals has awarded mining services provider Schlam, a multimillion-dollar supply agreement for both its product services divisions. The contract will see Schlam Payload Solutions supply Fortescue with dump bodies and buckets, while Schlam People Solutions will provide skilled on-site mechanical and fabrication services for a minimum of three years with options to extend. Schlam CEO Matt Thomas said the agreement's value is expected to reach over A$90-million. “Fortescue will be one of the first operators to receive the Hercules EXO since its successful trial and market release,” Thomas said. “The Hercules EXO is a 240-t class iron-ore-specific dump body that is 20% lighter than the company's already class-leading Hercules. The decreased weight gives miners a greater payload potential, while a complete redesign and innovative material selection have resulted in a 100% increase in service life.” To date, Schlam has supplied almost 60 Hercules bodies to Fortescue’s fleet of mining trucks and will deliver a further 50 in the next financial year alone. “The agreement will underpin our journey to introduce the latest robotic technology to transform our manufacturing processes and develop a state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing facility right here in Western Australia,” said Thomas.
