JSE-listed Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) has appointed Rotshidzwa Manenzhe as interim CFO for a term of six months, while the company seeks a permanent successor. This follows the resignation of Hanré Rossouw as CFO and executive director, to take up a position at Sasol. Although Manenzhe is not an executive director of the board, the company obtained formal dispensation from the JSE for her interim appointment. She also served as interim CFO in 2018, before Rossouw’s appointment.
