PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold junior Kingsgate Consolidated has appointed engineering firm CR3 to refurbish and restart the Chatree gold mine, in Thailand. Mobilisation of CR3 personnel to Chatree is expected through June with work to commence in July. In conjunction with the finalisation of the scope of work with CR3, Kingsgate on Thursday also reported that the long lead items required to refurbish the plant have now been ordered. Kingsgate recently secured a $15-million bridge facility to support the refurbishment and restart of the Chatree gold mine. Kingsgate was forced to place its Chatree gold miner on care and maintenance at the start of 2017, after the Thai government in 2016 announced that all gold mining in the country would cease.
