PERTH (miningweekly.com) – European technology developer Metso Outotec will partner with Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) on a global exclusive cooperation agreement on the delivery of Metso Outetec’s SwirlFlow agitation technology for the bauxite and alumina sector outside of China. Metso Outotec said on Tuesday that the combination of the companies’ leading expertise in their respective fields will allow the parties to create the strongest offering to the market for the use of SwirlFlow technology in the refinery precipitation tanks. “Sustainability is a top priority for Metso Outotec. In addition to our own investments to develop technology for sustainable alumina processing, we are pleased to be able to announce our cooperation with CSIRO. This will allow us to meet our customers’ growing demand such as lower capital installation, reduced spare parts costs and increase in precipitation tank availability,” said Metso Outotec director of light metals Dr Alessio Scarsella. CSIRO research programme director for processing Andrew Jenkin said that the CSIRO’s leading technology in SwirlFlow agitation has been pioneered at the refinery precipitation tanks of a tier-one client, leading to significantly reduced maintenance costs and improved operational time between descaling events.
