Aim- and BSE-listed Botswana Diamonds’ ground geophysics survey on its Thorny River property in South Africa has led to the discovery of the largest anomaly to date on the project, consistent with a kimberlite pipe of 25 m in diameter. A detailed drilling programme is planned for July to August, during the country’s dry season. “The discovery of our largest anomaly to date is an important development for Thorny River as this could add significant additional kimberlite tonnage to the developing mine plan,” chairperson John Teeling says. As a result of a thorough assessment of historical data, five targets were selected for detailed ground geophysics using gravity and electrical resistivity tomography and reviewed by independent consultant GeoFocus of South Africa. All targets produced results consistent with kimberlite, with three of the targets being within 200 m of the River Blow.
