Copper prices fell for a third day in a row on Thursday and tin slumped to a one-week low as a gloomy economic outlook for top metals consumer China fanned concerns about a global recession, though a soft US dollar lent some support. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.3% at $9 343/t as of 07:24 GMT. The most-traded July contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange ended daytime trading 0.5% lower at 71 080 yuan ($10 562) a tonne. Copper is often used as a gauge of global economic health.
