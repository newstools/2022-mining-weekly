PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Major BHP has announced the retirement of Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford as nonexecutive directors at the conclusion of the 2022 annual general meeting (AGM). Broomhead has been a director of BHP since March 2010 and in 2021 the board requested Broomhead seek re-election at the 2021 AGM for a further year while the group considered key strategic corporate transactions including unification of the corporate group and the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside. At the time, Broomhead informed the board that he would remain on until the 2022 AGM. Mogford has been a director of BHP since October 2017 and is an oil and gas expert. He has confirmed his decision to retire following the completion of the divestment of BHP’s oil and gas assets through the merger with Woodside. Mogford will step down from the role of chair of the Sustainability Committee in June and Gary Goldberg will be appointed chair of the Sustainability Committee. BHP chair Ken MacKenzie said that BHP continued to apply a robust approach to board renewal and to focus on succession planning in 2022. “As part of this process, we are delighted to have appointed Catherine Tanna and Michelle Hinchliffe to our board earlier this year. The board will continue to regularly assess its current skills and expected requirements for the future.”
