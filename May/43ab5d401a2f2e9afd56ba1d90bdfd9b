Toronto-listed Talon Metals has announced a new record at the Tamarack nickel project, in Minnesota, with 23.44 m of massive sulphide nickel and copper mineralisation. The record drill forms part of 26 new drill hole results that Talon reported on Wednesday.  All the new holes have intercepted nickel/copper mineralisation, with assays pending. “We continue to drill impressive amounts of massive sulphide nickel mineralisation. These results continue to demonstrate high grades of nickel and copper mineralisation within the main zone (resource area) at the Tamarack nickel project. “We continue to see thick pooling of the high-grade massive sulphide with a record intercept length of 23.44 m,” commented chief exploration and operations officer Brian Goldner. The Tamarack project has a supply agreement with electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the company aims to produce its first product by 2026. “The four drill rigs at site are now completely focused on infill drilling within the main zone with the goal of upgrading the high-grade resource from the inferred category to the indicated category. “We are on target to complete our infill programme for our prefeasibility study by the end of May, and then the rigs will be deployed outside the main zone with the goal of making new discoveries at the Tamarack nickel project,” commented CEO Henri van Rooyen.
