NYSE- and TSX-listed McEwen Mining is hunting for a new CFO and COO to fill the positions of Anna Ladd-Kruger, who is retiring to focus on her health and family, and Peter Mah, who resigned for personal reasons. In the interim, Perry Ing – a previous CFO of McEwen – will assume the CFO responsibilities, the company said on Friday. Ladd-Kruger would depart after the first-quarter reporting is complete. Mah would step down on June 3 and responsibility for oversight of operations will be assumed on an interim basis by William (Bill) Shaver, currently a director of the company. Most recently, Shaver served as COO of INV Metals before its sale to Dundee Precious Metals. “The focus of the company going forward is on stabilising its operations after a challenging period, divesting certain assets, and advancing our most significant value driver, the giant Los Azules copper project, towards key milestones,” McEwen stated.
