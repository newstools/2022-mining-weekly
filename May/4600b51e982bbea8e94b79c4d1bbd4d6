Aim- and AltX-listed Jubilee Metals has appointed Manuel Lino Silva de Sousa Oliveira (Ollie) as independent nonexecutive director, effective immediately, and as independent nonexecutive chairperson, effective June 1. He will succeed nonexecutive chairperson and founder Colin Bird, who decided late in 2021 to retire from the board. Bird will still advise the company on special projects, but will have no executive duties. CEO Leon Coetzer welcomes Oliveira to the board, saying he brings vast experience, knowledge and understanding of financial markets to his new position. Oliveira founded Greengrove Capital and is FD of The Diamond Trading Company. He also serves on the board of major iron-ore miner Vale and Chilean multinational copper miner Antofagasta Minerals. Bird comments in a statement that he never foresaw Jubilee forging such a unique path in the South African platinum and chrome sector, and in the Zambian copper sector – one that took Jubilee from a prospective underground miner to a global player in the extraction of metals from waste. He says he has no doubt that Oliveira is the right person to help steer Jubilee into the next phase of its international evolution. Meanwhile, Pedja Kovacevic will step into the role of Jubilee chief strategy officer to advance the company’s global expansion drive. Kovacevic will leave his current role as group CFO and be succeeded by Peet van Coller.
