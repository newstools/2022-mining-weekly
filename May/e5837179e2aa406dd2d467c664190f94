Tony McCluskey will retire as FD of titanium minerals and zircon producer Kenmare Resources after 30 years with the company. He is expected to step down from the Kenmare board on May 26 and from his executive role later this year. McCluskey joined Kenmare as company secretary and financial controller in 1991. He was appointed to the board as FD in 1999. As part of the company's succession planning, Kenmare’s nomination committee has started a process to recruit a successor. It will consider both internal and external candidates. “I have enjoyed my journey with Kenmare enormously since the very early days and I feel that now is the right time to step down from the board as FD. "In 2021, the company delivered a record financial performance and the fundamentals of the business have never been stronger. I will miss working with all my friends and colleagues in Kenmare deeply, and I feel confident that the company is now well-positioned to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests, and I will continue to follow Kenmare’s progress with pride,” McCluskey comments. Kenmare MD Michael Carvill says McCluskey has played a pivotal role in the development of Kenmare over more than 30 years, helping to establish the company as the largest supplier of ilmenite in the world. "We thank him for his tremendous contribution to the company’s success over this extended period, particularly to lender negotiations. He leaves Kenmare in robust financial health. "It is rare to have the opportunity to work alongside someone for as long as we have with each other and I wish Tony the very best for the next chapter of his life," he adds.
