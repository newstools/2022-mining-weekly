ASX- and Aim-listed Aura Energy has appointed Patrick Mutz as an independent nonexecutive director of the company, effective May 18. Aura is focused on the development of its 85%-owned Tiris uranium project, in Mauritania. Specialising in uranium projects in the US, Australia and Africa, Mutz holds over 40 years of international mining experience across technical, managerial, consulting, executive and director roles, across all aspects of the mining industry from exploration through to project development, mining and mine rehabilitation. He also has uranium operational experience in opencut, underground and in-situ mining and related processing. He is currently MD and CEO of Image Resources, a Western Australian mineral sands mining company. Here, he led Image through the successful transition from advanced explorer to profitable mining company, including feasibility study, capital raising, construction, rapid commissioning and full production that led to early repayment of all debt and payment of yearly dividends after the second and third years of operation. Mutz holds a BSc (Honours) and an MBA, both from the University of Phoenix, and is a Fellow of AusIMM. “I am delighted to be joining the Aura Energy board, and especially at a time of strengthening demand for new supplies of uranium as governments around the world are reassessing the importance of nuclear power as a critical technology in the transition to low-carbon global energy generation. "With my experience in uranium projects across several jurisdictions and stages of development, I look forward to contributing value to Aura, as the company advances to near-term uranium production,” Mutz comments.
