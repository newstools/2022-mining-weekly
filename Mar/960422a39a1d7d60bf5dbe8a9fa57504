Diamond miner De Beers has earned revenue of $650-million from its second sales cycle this year. This follows the $660-million in revenue earned in the first cycle of the year and is an improvement on the $550-million of revenue earned in the second sales cycle of 2021. De Beers says it continues to implement a flexible approach to its global sightholder sales and auctions owing to restrictions on the movement of people and products in various jurisdictions around the world. Commenting on demand, CEO Bruce Cleaver says the second sales cycle of the year saw the continuation of robust rough diamond demand, underpinned by sustained positive consumer sentiment.
