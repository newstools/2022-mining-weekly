PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior gold miner Aurelia Metals has temporarily suspended production at its Dargues gold mine, in New South Wales, owing to extreme weather conditions. The ASX-listed company told shareholders that record rainfall had impacted both the underground mine and the surface infrastructure, including the tailing storage facility (TSF). While the integrity of the TSF had not been compromised, the rainfall and associated runoff had accumulated in the TSF to a level that had filled the operational storage capacity, meaning there was the possibility of a water release to downstream waterways if high rainfall continued, Aurelia warned. As a result, processing operations have been suspended to avoid further water to the TSF. MD and CEO Dan Clifford said that the company took its environmental responsibility seriously. “We have notified the appropriate regulators about the impact of the rainfall and continue to work closely with them to manage the situation. Independent accredited laboratory testing of the accumulated water shows it satisfies the requirement for use as stock water. “In addition, we are conducting extensive water quality sampling of the immediate downstream environment in the event of an offsite release.” The underground mine continues to operate on a restricted basis. Aurealia told shareholders that the duration of the suspension would be dependent on weather conditions, but noted that rainfall was expected to diminish over the coming days.
