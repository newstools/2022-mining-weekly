The former president and CEO of Bonterra Resources, Pascal Hamelin, has been appointed new CEO of Abcourt Mines, succeeding founder Renaud Hinse, who is retiring. Hamelin holds a mining engineering degree and has 30 years of experience in mining, project management and exploration. Over the years, he has held positions of general manager, VP operations and president of Metanor Resources. Chairperson Francois Mestrallet said he was confident that Hamelin’s experience and leadership would enable Abcourt to continue its growth path. Mestrallet also thanked Hinse for his long tenure as CEO, noting that under his leadership, Abcourt acquired the Elder and Sleeping giant mines, which were the most significant assets of the company. Incoming CEO Hamelin stated that his immediate focus would be on reviewing the company’s strategy to better advance the projects. “Abcourt owns high-quality assets with high potential for resource expansions in the very prolific Abitibi region in Quebec,” he noted.
