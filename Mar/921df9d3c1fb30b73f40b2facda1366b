PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Isaac River coal project has been granted a site-specific environmental authority (EA) from the Queensland government, marking a major milestone for ASX-listed Bowen Coking Coal. The state government has also approved the Progressive Rehabilitation and Closure Plan (PRCP) for the project, making Isaac River one of the first coal projects to have an up-front PRCP and schedule assessed and approved. The Isaac River project contains a resource estimate of 8.7-million tonnes, of which 8.3-million tonnes is classified as measured and indicated. Bowen Coking Coal has previously stated that the project could support a run-of-mine production target of 0.4-million tonnes to 0.6-million tonnes a year, over a four- to five-year period. “The EA approval is a major milestone for the project and is now on its way to becoming another one of Bowen’s new mines,” said MD and CEO Gerhard Redelinghuys. “The project requires only a modest capital investment as it is planned to leverage off existing third-party infrastructure. Isaac River will contribute additional high-quality metallurgical coal to the company’s sales mix, complementing the Bluff and Broadmeadow East/Burton projects which are on track for near-term exports.” Redelinghuys noted that the Mining Lease application and federal environmental approval under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act were underway and were expected to be completed early in the third quarter of this year.
