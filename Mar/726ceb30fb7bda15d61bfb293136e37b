The company on Thursday announced that it had raised A$7.25-million in the retail entitlement offer, placing 144.9-million shares at a price of 5c each. The remaining shortfall under the retail entitlement offer was allocated under the underwriting agreement and sub-underwriting agreement, raising a further A$5.9-million. Following the issue of the new shares, Ora Banda’s major shareholder, Hawke’s Point and its associates, will increase their voting power in the company to 45.3%.
