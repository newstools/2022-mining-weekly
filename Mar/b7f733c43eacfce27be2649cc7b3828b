Bullion major AngloGold Ashanti is continuing to progress work at its US-based projects and expects to have Tier-1 gold-producing assets in Nevada by 2025, CEO Alberto Calderon has said. In a speech to the Melbourne Mining Club this week, he stated that AngloGold was confident that it would receive the permits for its assets in the Beatty district of Nevada, stating that the parameters and standards that it had to deliver were clear. "We know where we are headed," Calderon said. He also noted that the US was inviting gold mining investments. AngloGold in January concluded the $370-million acquisition of Corvus Gold, through which it obtained the North Bullfrog and Mother Lode projects, as well as exploration assets. These assets were combined with AngloGold’s own neighbouring projects, providing an opportunity for the Beatty district to be a Tier-1 asset. Despite coming onto AngloGold’s radar after the Quebradona copper/gold project, the newly acquired Nevada assets would be in production before the Colombia project, which had faced an environmental approval setback. AngloGold had to go back to the drawing board on some environmental information. In November, the environmental agency notified the mining company of its decision to “archive” the environmental licence application for Quebradona, stating that it did not have enough information to take a substantive decision. This has resulted in an up-to-two-year delay. Calderon said this week that AngloGold would be ready to resubmit its environmental application in the next 12 months. Quebradona is one of the world’s pre-eminent copper projects, expected to treat about 6.2-million tonnes a year of ore, producing three-billion pounds of copper, 1.5-million ounces of gold and 21-million ounces of silver over about 23 years.
