Highland Valley Copper (HVC) has been awarded the Copper Mark, diversified miner Teck Resources reported on Wednesday. HVC is the Copper Mark’s first recipient in Canada and also the first of Teck’s copper operations to achieve certification. Teck stated that it planned to achieve certification for each of its copper operations in future, including includes Carmen de Andacollo and QB2, which was expected to begin production in the second half of 2022. “Copper is an essential material for the low-carbon future, and our focus is on helping meet the growing global need for copper in an environmentally and socially responsible way,” Teck president and CEO Don Lindsay. “We are proud that Highland Valley Copper has been awarded the Copper Mark, demonstrating the operation’s commitment to sustainability and to ensuring customers have the information they need on our performance as a responsible copper producer.” Copper Mark is a voluntary assurance framework to promote responsible production practices and demonstrate commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
