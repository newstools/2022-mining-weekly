PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Mali government has granted ASX-listed Firefinch a mining licence for the Finkola permit, which is contiguous with its Morila gold project. The company told shareholders on Wednesday that the receipt of the mining licence paved the way for the start of mining at the Beledjo-Koting deposit, which is estimated to contain 20 000 oz of gold in ore reserves. “The grant of the Permis d’Exploitation for Finkola is another important step in ramping up production at Morila. Beledjo gives us another ore source and importantly provides oxide ore for blending with fresh ore from the Morila super pit,” said Firefinch MD Dr Michael Anderson. The Permis d’Exploitation has been granted for a period of ten years with renewals possible for ten years. The mining licence also provides a development pipeline for other prospects within the Finkola licence. Firefinch on Wednesday said that further drilling is planned at the K2 and K3 prospects at Finkola for 2022 with the aim to define mineral resources and assess the potential for these to contribute to future mill feed. Other prospects within the licence will be advanced with surface geochemistry and aircore drilling.
