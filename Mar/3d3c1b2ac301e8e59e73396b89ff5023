Brazil has selected the Jaguar project as a “strategic minerals” project, recognising its status as a significant long-life nickel sulphide project, ASX-listed Centaurus Metals reported on Monday. The Strategic Minerals Policy is part of the Investment Partnership Programme, a new Brazil governmental initiative designed to support companies, while developing their projects across the country. According to the Mines and Energy Ministry, the policy acknowledges a strategic priority dimension to the projects selected by an InterMinisterial Committee. “We applaud the Brazil government for introducing such a strong initiative for mineral projects considered to be of strategic importance to the country,” Centaurus MD Darren Gordon said. The scoping study envisages the development of openpit and underground mines supplying a 2.7-million-tonne-a-year nickel sulphate plant over an initial 13-year mine life. The mine is expected to produce more than 20 000 t/y of recovered nickel in sulphate and more than 9 600 t/y of mixed sulphide precipitate.
