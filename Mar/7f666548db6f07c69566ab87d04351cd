Impala Platinum (Implats) has concluded agreements to further increase its shareholding in Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) to 36.41%, up from the 35.66% previously held. The agreement, which Implats announced on March 18, would see Implats acquiring a further 2.17-million RBPlat shares by April 1, constituting about 0.75% of the RBPlat shares in issue. Implats said it planned to buy more RBPlat shares in the near future. Implats in November last year made an offer to RBPlat shareholders to buy their shares in RBPlat for R150 apiece, comprising R90 in cash and 0.3 of an ordinary Implats share for each RBPlat share held.
