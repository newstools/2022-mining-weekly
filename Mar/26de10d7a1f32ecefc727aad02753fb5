Canadian silver mining company Silver X has applied to list its common shares for trading on the Lima stock exchange. Listing on the Lima exchange will give regional investors easier access to invest in the future of the company, says CEO Jose Garcia. “Silver X believes in the future of Peru and our flagship Nueva Recuperada project will make Silver X the only junior silver producer listed on the BVL,” he says. The Lima stock exchange is a participant of the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano, through which it is increasingly integrated with the regional equity markets in Colombia, Chile and Mexico.
