Gold exploration company Vanstar Mining Resources has unveiled plans for a 4 000-m drill programme at the Bousquet-Odyno gold project, in which it has an option to earn up to 75% from Iamgold. The drilling programme, which will begin next month, is designed to test areas down-plunge from known high-grade zones, as well as test additional areas on the surface, the junior says. Located along the Cadillac Break, the Bousquet-Odyno project comprises 37 contiguous mining claims covering 1 492 ha between the towns of Rouyn-Noranda and Malartic in Quebec. Vanstar and Iamgold entered into a letter of intent in November and have now made their option agreement definitive. Under the terms, Vanstar has the option to complete as operator at least C$4-million in exploration expenditures over four years and will have the right to earn up to a 75% interest in the property. Iamgold will have the right to earn back a 50% interest by spending four times the exploration expenditures made on the property since the completion of the second earn-in period within a time of three to five years.
