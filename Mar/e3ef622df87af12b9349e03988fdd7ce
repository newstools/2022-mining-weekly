Diversified miner South32 reports that owing to a failure to satisfy certain commercial conditions, the sale of the Meyerton-based Metalloys manganese alloy smelter agreed by Samancor Manganese and Satka Investments, will not proceed. The sale of the smelter by the parties was agreed in November 2021. Production at Metalloys ceased in March 2020 when South32 announced it was reconsidering the future economic viability of the plant. The site is expected to remain on care and maintenance while South32 assesses future options for the smelter. The Samancor Manganese joint venture (JV) is owned 60% by South32 and 40% by Anglo American. The JV holds ownership interests in the Mamatwan and Wessels manganese mines and Metalloys manganese alloy smelter in South Africa, as well as the Gemco manganese mine in Australia.
