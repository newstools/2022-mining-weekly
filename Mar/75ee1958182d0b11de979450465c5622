PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has unveiled its life-of-mine (LoM) production plans and cost expectations for the next five years. The ASX- and LSE-listed miner on Friday said that it expected to produce about 370 000 oz up to 2026, at an average all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of A$1 191/oz. To 2033, total LoM production is expected to reach 3.5-million ounces, at an all-in sustaining cost of A$1 110/oz. The Sayama operation, in Mali, is expected to contribute an average 243 000 oz/y at an average aAISC of A$993/oz over the current 12-year mine life to 2033. The Syama oxide operation’s production has been extended from 2023 to 2026, reflecting exploration success. Development of the Tabakoroni sulphide mine at an estimated cost of A$80-million to A$100-million has been deferred to 2026, owing to the extension of oxide production. Resolute noted that, based on the current schedule, development is expected to commence late in 2024 with Tabakoroni sustaining Syama sulphide production between 250 000 oz/y to 300 000 oz/y from 2026. The Tabakaroni sulphide operation is expected to start in 2026, with an estimated gold production of 664 000 oz over an eight-year mine life. Meanwhile, LoM production from the Mako gold mine, in Senegal, is expected to reach 607 000 oz, at an AISC of A$1 071/oz over its remaining six-year mine life. “Our latest LoM plan reflects an improved production profile over the current 12-year mine life at Syama incorporating the successful exploration campaigns which have extended oxide production for an additional two years together with exceptional drilling results at Tabakoroni. This allows us to defer the development of the Tabakoroni sulphide mine as we continue to assess and optimise the plan for the development of this resource,” said Resolute CEO Stuart Gale. “Syama has a significant gold endowment and there is still a great deal of exploration to be undertaken in this area. We remain very confident that the Syama operations will continue developing and extending beyond what we have published today. “In addition, we remain focused on identifying further extension and development opportunities at Mako in Senegal, where we also expect to extend our mining activities beyond the current mine life.”
