Aim-listed Africa-focussed lithium explorer and developer Atlantic Lithium CFO and company secretary Amanda Harsas has been promoted to FD, effective March 16. As a senior finance executive and chartered accountant, she has a demonstrable record and over 20 years’ experience in strategic finance, business transformation, commercial finance, customer and supplier negotiations and capital management. Prior to joining Atlantic Lithium, Harsas worked across several sectors including healthcare, insurance, retail and professional services. She holds a bachelor of business and has international experience in Asia, Europe and the US. Atlantic Lithium chairperson Neil Herbert says since her appointment in 2020, Harsas has performed “exceptionally” and that the company is pleased she is joining the board at a crucial time when Atlantic Lithium takes its fully funded Ghana-based lithium project towards production. “I also express thanks for the overwhelming number of condolence messages received following the passing of the company's founder Vincent Mascolo, which reflects the impact Vincent had in life and work. “We knew and worked with Vincent for many years and recognise the importance to bring all of his hard work in Atlantic Lithium to fruition,” says Herbert.
