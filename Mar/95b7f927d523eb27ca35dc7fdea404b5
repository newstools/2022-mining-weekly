LONDON – Russian steel giant Evraz's London-listed shares have been temporarily suspended by Britain's financial regulator after top shareholder Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by Britain, a notice from the London Stock Exchange shows. The Financial Conduct Authority has temporarily suspended the London listing from 11:00 GMT on Thursday "in order to protect investors pending clarification of the impact of the UK sanctions", the LSE's notice said. Evraz shares fell 16% after the Abramovich sanctions announcement.
