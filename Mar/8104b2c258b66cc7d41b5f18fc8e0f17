In an ongoing court case relating to the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Namibia refusing to grant copper explorer and developer Deep-South Resources a licence for its Haib copper project, the miner reports that, although the Ministry filed additional documents as part of the review record, these did not provide any evidence supporting the Ministry’s decision. This follows the failure of the Ministry’s legal counsel, earlier this month, to file its defence affidavit for the refusal to grant the prospecting licence – EPL 3140. A High Court judge previously granted an extension to the Ministry to file the documents it stated it had recently discovered and that were not part of the record of proceedings. However, the Ministry had only until March 11 to complete its filing. In a statement, Deep-South notes that the documents filed by the Ministry on March 11 were copies of documents contained in previous filings or pertaining to previous licence tenures. The next hearing in court will be held on March 22, where the next step in the legal proceedings will be considered.
