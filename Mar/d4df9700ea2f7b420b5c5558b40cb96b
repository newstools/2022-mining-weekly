Dual-listed Barrick Gold’s Kibali gold mine has had a strong start to the year and is on track to equal its 2021 production this year. Last year, it again replaced the reserves depleted by mining, and the KZ trend of orebodies continued to deliver opportunities for significant openpit and underground growth, the company added. Speaking to media, Barrick president and CE Mark Bristow said Kibali, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), had recorded a number of other key deliverables during the current quarter. These include the signing of a cahier de charge with the surrounding communities to formalise their role in identifying and overseeing the mine’s investment in social development projects. Another section of the Durba road to Watsa has been completed and the resettlement of the Kalimva-Ikamva and Pamao villages has started with the first group of people moving into their new homes. On the health and safety front, there have been zero lost-time injuries during the quarter so far, the malaria and HIV programmes continue to deliver infection rate reductions and 60% of the company’s employees have been vaccinated against Covid-19, compared with a national average of 1%. African Parks and Barrick are also working to reintroduce white rhino to the Garamba national park. In what Barrick notes will be the largest exercise of its kind, the plan envisages the relocation of about 50 white rhinos to Garamba, creating a new population group which is critical in the long-term plan to protect this species. In line with Barrick’s development strategy, the mine also launched the Garamba Alliance in partnership with the US Agency for International Development. “Barrick is continuing to invest in the DRC, not only by developing the many new growth opportunities which are extending Kibali’s life, but also through pursuing greenfields exploration and other opportunities across the country as we search for our next world-class discovery,” Bristow said.
