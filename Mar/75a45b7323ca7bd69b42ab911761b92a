Russian gold miner Nord Gold (Nordgold) said four board members left the company on Monday, the latest in a string of exits of foreigners from the boards of Russian companies. Michael Nossal, Brian Beamish, David Morgan and John Munro have stepped down from the board "effective immediately", Nordgold said. Nossal, who was Nordgold's nonexecutive chairperson, is Australian. Morgan is British, and Beamish and Munro are both South African, according to UK filings for the company.
