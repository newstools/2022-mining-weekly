Mining exploration company Altona Rare Earths plans to proceed with a Phase 2 drill programme at its Monte Muambe rare earth project, in Tete, Mozambique. This follows after a Phase 1 drill programme, which got under way in October 2021, showed above-average rare earth element levels and two new mineralised areas. Phase 1 comprised 590 m of diamond drilling and 2 541 m of reverse circulation drilling. Phase 2 drilling will start in April and endure for 12 months. The company envisions this next drilling to confirm indications found in Phase 1 and inform a maiden mineral resource estimate and scoping study. While Altona spent £580 000 on Phase 1, it plans to spend about £1.2-million on Phase 2.
