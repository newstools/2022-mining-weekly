Scandinavia-headquartered gold explorer and miner Akobo Minerals has renewed its existing exploration licence of 182 km2 in the Akobo region of Ethiopia, which Akobo Minerals says is the result of many years of positive relationships with the Ethiopian Ministry of Mines. Akobo Minerals also operates in the Gambela region and Dima Woreda, in south-west Ethiopia. The exploration licence renewal provides Akobo Minerals a three-year exploration period, with yearly renewals of up to ten years, as well as a solidified future presence in the Akobo project, thereby removing any concerns regarding the licence’s length. It also means Akobo Minerals has the ability to think long-term about how to increase exploration activities and provides freedom to drill and mine the best targets across the entire licence area. Akobo Minerals CEO Jørgen Evjen says the renewal establishes a “very strong long-term” position for the company for both mining and exploration activities in the Akobo region. “It ensures that we can secure additional highly prospective targets that we will be able to feed into our Segele processing plant for years to come.”

He adds that securing the licence for an extended period is a much-appreciated sign of good faith in Akobo by Ethiopia’s Ministry of Mines. “We thank them warmly for their ongoing support.”
