Gold-focused streamlining and royalty company Triple Flag is forecasting a significant increase in its production levels over the next five years, with output averaging at 110 000 gold-equivalent ounces (GEOs) a year. This compares with GEO production of 83 602 oz in 2021 and a guidance of 90 000 oz to 95 000 oz in 2022. Triple Flag explains that production in the next five years will be driven by Northparkes and Dargues, in Australia, Buritica, in Colombia, Pumpkin Hollow and Gunnison in the US, Gunnison, well as the resumption of ATO, in Mongolia. The 15 000 GEO a year increase, compared with 2021’s outlook, was owing to the addition of ore feed from Nortparkes E31 openpit, which will allow the mine to fully use the 7.6-million-tonne-a-year processing capacity earlier than originally planned. Over the ten-year period ending 2032, Triple Flag expects production to average at 105 000 GEOs a year. Centerra’s Kemess project and Twin Metals’ Tamarack project are not included in the outlook.
