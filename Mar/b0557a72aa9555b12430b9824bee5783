Palladium prices surged on Tuesday as the Russia-Ukraine crisis fuelled supply worries, with the conflict also powering safe-haven gold back through the key $2 000 level. Spot palladium jumped 5.9% to $3 173.02 per ounce by 0716 GMT, resuming its rally after slipping from an all-time high of $3 440.76 to close marginally lower on Monday. Platinum rose 2.2% to $1 147.31. Prices of Palladium have skyrocketed this year to all-time highs as financial restrictions on Russia - the biggest producer of the auto-catalyst metal - for its invasion of Ukraine are expected to disrupt shipments and worsen a supply shortage. "The ongoing crisis in Russia is causing a rally in the entire PGM (platinum group metals) complex," said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal Bang Commodities. Spot gold gained 1% to $2 014.40 per ounce, after climbing to $2 020.47 earlier in the day, its highest since August 2020. US gold futures were up 1.2% to $2 020.50. Spot silver advanced 1% to $25.92. With gold's momentum, it seems inevitable that the metal will be testing record levels within a week or two, said Matt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index. Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, rose 0.8% to 1,062.7 tonnes on Monday - their highest since March 2021. A break above $1 999 per ounce for spot gold could lead to a gain at $2 028, Reuters' technical analyst Wang Tao said earlier in the session.
