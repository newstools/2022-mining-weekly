Aim-listed phosphate producer and developer Kropz has achieved its first production of phosphate rock concentrate from its Elandsfontein operation, in Gauteng, the company said on March 18. Plant commissioning at the Elandsfontein operation began in the fourth quarter of last year and has since achieved a concentrate grade of 31% phosphorus pentoxide, which is in line with management’s expectations. Concentrate samples will be prepared for shipment to a number of potential buyers to confirm product specifications, Kropz said. Sales to smaller local customers in South Africa will begin towards the end of March. The focus for Kropz at Elandsfontein has now shifted to ramping up the operation to achieve nameplate capacity and enable the first commercial large-scale shipment of concentrate. “The interest that we are receiving from the market and industry is positive. . . as we optimise processing recoveries and make our first bulk sales,” Kropz CEO Mark Summers said.
