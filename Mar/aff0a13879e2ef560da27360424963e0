Africa-focused Asante Gold has appointed David Anthony as president and CEO, replacing founder Douglas MacQuarrie, who had been made nonexecutive chairperson of the company. Anthony joined Asante as COO in July last year, with the responsibility to build and lead the company’s operations team to refurbish the Bibiani mine, in Ghana. Before joining Asante, he was COO of Cardinal Resources, which developed the five-million-ounce Namdini gold deposit, in Ghana, before it was bought by Shandong Gold for $500-million. His previous positions include working with Barrick in Africa for ten years, where he became COO of African Barrick Gold.
