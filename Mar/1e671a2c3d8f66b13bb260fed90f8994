Aim-listed Cora Gold has started a 7 500 m drilling programme at the Sanankoro gold project, in Mali. The programme is aimed at enhancing the current mineral resource estimate of 809 300 oz and will also inform a definitive feasibility study. Cora says all deposits at the project remain open at depth and along strike, proving strong expansion potential. The drilling is due to be completed in the second quarter.
