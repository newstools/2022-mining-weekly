Mineral exploration and development company Deep-South Resources reports that, at a hearing held on March 22, the judge ordered the legal counsel of the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Namibia to file its defence affidavit in the refusal of a licence for the Haib copper project by April 22 at the latest. Deep-South’s attorneys will have until May 13 to file their reply to the defence of the Ministry. The judge has also drawn the attention of the parties to Part 6 of the Rules of High Court. Part 6 deals with sanctions for failure to comply with rules, directions or court orders. Sanctions could be applied for failure to respect delays or undue request of extensions. The court will hold another hearing on May 18, to define the further procedures with regard to the review of the decision of the Minister to deny the renewal of the exploration licence. The company says it will provide regular updates in this regard and any other matter concerning this situation.
