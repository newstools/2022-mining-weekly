PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Minbos Resources has settled on the design for its Cabinda phosphate fertiliser plant, in Angola. The company on Thursday revealed that the plant has been designed with an initial production capacity of 150 000 t/y with capability to expand up to 450 000 t/y. Based on current estimates, commissioning is expected in the first half of 2023. “The Cabinda phosphate project is of national significance to Angola, so when it came to designing a plant, we had to ensure we had a project partner who could deliver a world-class plant. Engaging FEECO has and will deliver this outcome,” said Minbos CEO Lindsay Reed. “Working in a Covid and supply chain constrained environment in the last year has been challenging for the Minbos team in Angola and Australia, but particularly for the FEECO and International Fertilizer Development Center teams in the US. I would like to thank everyone for their work in challenging times to produce this definitive feasibility study (DFS) design. “The company is looking forward to delivering the DFS and final investment decision in the coming months, as we prepare to get into production in the first half of 2023,” said Reed.
