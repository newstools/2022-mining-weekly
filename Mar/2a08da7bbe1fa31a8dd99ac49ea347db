ASX- and JSE-listed consultancy DRA Global says its MD and CEO Andrew Naude has resigned and will step down once a hand-over process to interim CEO James Smith is finalised. Naude, who joined DRA as a senior executive in 2013, has been the longest-serving director in the company’s history. Particularly, he led DRA’s international expansion from South Africa and oversaw its transformation into a global mining services business operating across 19 offices on five continents. The company has started its search for a successor and will consider internal and external candidates. The handover to Smith has started and the terms of his interim appointment will be disclosed before it takes effect, DRA reports. He is currently responsible for DRA’s operations, maintenance and advisory business.
