German operators of hard coal-fired power plants are receiving regular amounts of imported feedstock from Russia and on-site coal inventories are filled until May, a note from Germany's utility industry association said on Wednesday. "Member companies are telling us that ... shipments from Russia are arriving in line with contractual agreements," Berlin-based BDEW said. "There are no production bottlenecks at the moment, all plants produce in line with plans and with demand," it added. Russia supplies around 50% of the hard coal burnt in German power stations. Other exporting countries include Australia, Indonesia, the United States, Colombia, South Africa and Canada. BDEW said qualities differed depending on origins and seaborne freight rates were currently high. Changing transport and supply chains could take several months. Germany has plenty of alternative power supply sources to burning hard coal, which provided 9.3% of national electricity production in 2021. These include renewables, brown coal from domestic mines, nuclear, gas, oil.
