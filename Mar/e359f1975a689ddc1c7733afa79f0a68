PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore major Fortescue Metals is optimistic on the iron-ore price outlook. Fortescue iron-ore COO Dino Otrano told delegates at the Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast conference, in Perth, that global market conditions remained supportive for iron-ore, with an expectation of increased activity in China in the coming months and constrained global iron-ore supply growth subject to Covid-19 constraints as well as disruption in the supply chain coming as a result of the recent conflict in Ukraine. The company in February reported record half-year shipments of 93.1-million tonnes, generating revenues of $8.1-bilion. “We've had a strong start to the second-half and we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance for the full year iron-ore shipments in the range of 180-million to 185-million tonnes, capex excluding Fortescue Future Industries in the range of $3-billion to $3.4 billion, and C1 costs guidance of A$15/t to A$15.50/t,” said Otrano. He noted that the company was closely monitoring its costs given the recent significant increase in fuel prices and that Fortescue remained focused on maintaining its industry-leading cost position. “We are making a significant investment in iron-ore growth, as well as energy infrastructure and new technologies to support the decarbonisation of our iron-ore operations. And we've got a keen eye on the future, pursuing exciting new opportunities in renewable energy and green industries as we transition to a vertically integrated green energy and resources company,” he added.
