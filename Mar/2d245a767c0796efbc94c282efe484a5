Exploration company Akobo Minerals has appointed Norwegian investment bank SpareBank1 Markets to advise on project financing for the company’s Segele project, in Ethiopia. SpareBank will work closely with Akobo to explore relevant funding opportunities, including equity, bank debt and offtake agreements. As soon as financing is in place, Akobo will build a small-scale plant for initial gold production before the end of the year.
