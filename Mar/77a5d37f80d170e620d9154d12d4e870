Aim- and JSE-listed Pan African Resources has secured five three-year exploration licences in north-east Sudan, covering an area of almost 1 100 km2. The Block 12 concessions are located about 70 km northwest of Port Sudan. Fourteen rock samples obtained during site reconnaissance yielded an average grade of 13.6 g/t gold. Pan African plans to spend $2.5-million on exploration in Sudan during the 2022 financial year, particularly targeting ten initial areas, based on the size of existing artisanal and alluvial workings. This work will start between April and June, in a phased manner. Block 12 is located on the same suture zone as the Hassai gold mine, which is the largest gold-producing mine in Sudan. Block 12 had undergone limited modern exploration work in the past, mainly consisting of soil and grab samples, channel sampling and trenching on a few targets, and shallow drilling. Sudan produced about 90 t of gold in 2021, making it the third-largest gold-producing country after Ghana and South Africa. “We believe the Block 12 concessions are highly prospective, and we look forward to reporting exploration results from these properties in due course. “Our exploration programme will be phased, with expenditure of about $7-million to be incurred during the first three years, to ensure we limit the group’s financial risk. “Further, before making any material investment decisions, we would need to be comfortable with the country’s operating environment,” says Pan African CEO Cobus Loots. The company has, up until now, focused only on gold mining in South Africa.
