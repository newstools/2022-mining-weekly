Canada-focused intermediate miner New Gold has appointed Patrick Godin as executive VP and COO with effect from May 2. Godin has more than 30 years of technical and operations experience in the mining industry. Most recently, he was COO of Pretium Resources (Pretivm) until it was sold to Newcrest Mining earlier this month. During his time at Pretivm, Godin was responsible for the operations of the Brucejack mine, in British Columbia. Prior to Pretivm, he was president and CEO of Stornoway Diamonds. Before that, he was COO and VP, responsible for the construction and the operations of the Renard diamond mine in Quebec. New Gold president and CEO Renaud Adams says Godin’s extensive technical and underground mining experience, particularly in Canada as both a mine operator and mine builder, will be invaluable to the company as it continues to advance underground development at Rainy River and C-Zone development at New Afton.
