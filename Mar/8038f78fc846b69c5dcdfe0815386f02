Unlisted Seduli Sutter Operations has poured its first gold at the Lincoln mine, in California, from stockpiled material and is currently completing commissioning activities to restart Stage 1 production at the underground mine. The company is targeting 220 t/d, with the aim of producing about 20 000 oz/y. The project is permitted for Stage 2 production of up to 1 000 t/d, about 80 000 oz/y. Aim-listed royalty and streaming firm Trident Royalties has a net smelter return royalty over production from the Lincoln mine. “First gold represents the beginning of Seduli's journey as it seeks to expand the Lincoln project into a successful, mid-size gold project situated in one of the most prolific gold-producing regions globally. Lincoln represents an important milestone in Trident's journey to meaningful cashflow generation, and we look forward to providing further updates as the project advances,” said Tident CEO and director Adam Davidson. Seduli CEO Toby Davis commented that the company had been working on completing the processing plant since October last year. “The rapid timeline to production, especially during a time of Covid-19-related challenges in sourcing supplies is a testimony to the dedication, ingenuity, and persistent hard work of the whole team at the mine. It's been a job well done. We are looking forward to seeing what this orebody will produce. The early signs are promising."
