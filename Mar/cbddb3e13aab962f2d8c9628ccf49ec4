Vancouver-based Silver Hammer has been granted a two-year drilling and surface disturbance exploration permit to drill at its past-producing Silverton silver mine, northeast of the Tonopah silver district in Nevada. The drilling is part of an exploration programme targeting extensions of the high-grade veins mined until the 1920s. The company plans to test several areas around the existing mine, as well as recently staked areas after refining targets. "Our primary focus remains our flagship Silver Strand project in Idaho; however, the first phases of fieldwork at Silverton were very encouraging and securing a two-year permit now puts us in position to accelerate towards drilling once we’ve refined and finalized our targets,” commented president and CEO Morgan Lekstrom. Earlier this year, Silver Hammer’s technical team staked an additional 19 claims expanding the Silverton land package to 620 total acres. Silverton is located in East Nevada’s “Silver Alley'' with historical production grades as high as 933 g/t silver. There has been limited to no modern-day drilling or subsurface exploration completed in the area since the 1920s.
