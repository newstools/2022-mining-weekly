Bullion major Barrick Gold’s interest in explorer and developer Reunion Gold has fallen below 10% after the company did not participate in the junior’s bought-deal private placement offering. Barrick now owns about 9.9875% of the shares of Reunion, which focuses on the Guinea Shield in South America. Barrick invested in Reunion in 2017. The companies in 2019 formed a 50:50 alliance to jointly explore for mineral projects in Guiana Shield. Barrick continues to have a right-of-first-refusal under the investor rights agreement in respect of the mineral projects that are subject to the strategic alliance, as well as Reunion’s Dorlin, Haute Mana and Boulanger projects.
