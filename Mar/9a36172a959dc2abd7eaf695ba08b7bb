PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Stellar Metals started share trading on the ASX on Friday, following an initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised A$7-million. The company is actively targeting battery minerals in its portfolio of five prospective copper and zinc projects in South Australia. The project portfolio includes ex BHP and Rio Tinto assets Evelyn Dam and the Torrens project, which are both prospective for large-scale iron oxide/copper/gold targets, the Linda zinc project, the Gunson project, which is adjacent to a series of opencut copper mines, and the Baratta project, which is prospective for copper as well as zinc/lead mineralisation. “We are thrilled to be listing on the ASX and thank all our investors, new and existing, who have supported us to date and see the value of our projects,” said Stellar CEO Colin Skidmore. “This is a major step in the journey of the company,” he added. Funds raised from the IPO will be used on detailed exploration work in the second quarter of this year. “We are excited about executing our upcoming exploration plans, shaped by our board and management team’s considerable knowledge, experience and exploration success in South Australia. We expect to hit the ground running and look forward to uncovering the potential of our portfolio of battery metals projects,” said Skidmore.
