Toronto-listed i-80 Gold has completed initial gold sales from residual heap leach operations at its Lone Tree and Ruby Hill projects, in Nevada, the company announced on Wednesday. "After less than a year in existence we have produced our first gold from ongoing residual leach projects while we continue to execute the development of several projects within our portfolio as planned with the goal of becoming a significant operator in the state of Nevada,” commented executive VP Matthew Gollat. Lone Tree provides i-80 with a competitive advantage in Nevada hosting important processing infrastructure to grow the company's business including an autoclave, CIL mill, and a heap leach facility complete with assay lab and gold refinery. Current gold production is the result of leaching existing heap leach pads. The nearby Brooks and Buffalo Mountain mining operations are currently being advanced with material to be trucked to the Lone Tree leach pad. Mining of the Brooks deposit is expected to start in the second half of 2022. The Ruby Hill Mine is located immediately west of the town of Eureka and is host to multiple deposits that i-80 believes collectively represent one of the biggest gold and silver resource endowments in the state of Nevada. The property is host to key infrastructure including heap leach facilities, a CIL circuit and mill. In the future, refractory mineralisation from Ruby Hill is expected to be trucked to the Lone Tree Complex for processing following its refurbishment. The primary source of production at Ruby Hill is material from the East Archimedes openpit mined from September 2020 to November 2021, as well as some residual leach from older material on the pad.
