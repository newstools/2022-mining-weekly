Toronto-listed Orvana Minerals said on Friday that it had temporarily suspended its Orovalle operations, in Spain, citing a lack of timely supply of materials caused by a national strike of transportation services. Several Spanish truckers' unions started a nationwide strike on March 14 over rising fuel prices and working conditions. The protest in the transport sector has disrupted the supply chains across all sectors. Orvana said it intended to resume normal production at Orovalle when transportation services restarted. According to Reuters, truck drivers on Friday said they would continue a 12-day strike “indefinitely”, after a meeting with Spain’s transport Minister ended in them rejecting a €1-billion support package.
