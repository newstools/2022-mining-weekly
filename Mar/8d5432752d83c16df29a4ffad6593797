HOUSTON – US coal producers said on Thursday they only have limited ability to boost exports and offset lost Russian volumes due to chronic industry underinvestment amid the clean energy transition. "The ability for the supply side to respond is tough," Jim Grech, CEO of Peabody Energy, said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Paul Vining, chairman of privately-held Westmoreland Mining, said US coal exports this year should be slightly higher than last year's 72-million tonnes, but be constrained from further growth due to staffing constraints and limited rail capacity.
