PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The resource estimate for the Ewoyaa lithium project, in Ghana, has increased by 42%, ASX and Nasdaq-listed Piedmont Lithium said on Wednesday. The company noted that its joint venture (JV) partner Atlantic Lithium had announced the completion of a mineral resource update for the Ewoyaa project, with the resource now standing at 30.1-million tonnes at 1.26% lithium oxide. “We are very pleased with the reported increase in mineral resources for the Ewoyaa project, notably the increase in the mineral resource in the indicated category,” said Piedmont CEO Patrick Brindle. Piedmont has an earn-in right to 50% of Atlantic’s Ghanaian projects, including Ewoyaa, and the company holds a 10% equity interest in Atlantic Lithium. Piedmont previously revealed the feasibility studies for Ewoyaa were due in 2022, with first production possible by 2024. “The Ewoyaa project is one of the best located spodumene projects in Africa, and its development is fundamental to our growth strategy as an important source of spodumene concentrate for our LHP2-Project. We look forward to Atlantic Lithium’s completion of a prefeasibility study for the Ewoyaa project, which will both increase the level of engineering definition for the project as well as provide important data needed to advance regulatory approvals for the project,” said Brindle.
