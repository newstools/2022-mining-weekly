PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Independent power producer Zenith Energy has inked an ecosystem framework agreement-deployment (ESAD) with Sydney-based clean technology innovator 5B, that could result in renewable energy penetration increasing on mine sites in the Goldfields and the Pilbara. The ESAD will permit Zenith to deploy 5B’s Maverick system, which is a prefabricated solar array, allowing for rapid deployment and increasing Zenith’s ability to expand renewable assets across sites. “We’ve been looking to increase renewable assets across multiple sites for some time, the question has always been around how we can achieve that in such a way that it is economically viable,” said Zenith MD Hamish Moffat. “The 5B Maverick system is re-deployable, meaning it can be integrated on mines with shorter tenure, and moved at the end of operations at those sites. It offers Zenith greater ability to leverage value from our initial capital expenditure, making it more cost effective to offer expanded renewable energy solutions for our clients.” 5B co-founder and CEO Chris McGrath said the strategic partnership was an important validation of 5B Maverick’s ability to reduce deployment complexity. “This has been a major barrier for solar installations on mine sites worldwide. “The agreement also shows that our cost reduction efforts over the past two years have worked; we’ve hit the price point where 5B Mavericks can be viably packed up, and redeployed elsewhere, substantially reducing the risk of stranded assets in mining, agricultural and industrial operations.” Zenith is currently looking at integrating the 5B Maverick system across three mine sites, including ASX-listed IGO’s Nova nickel mine, gold miner Red 5’s King of the Hill operation, and Calidus Resource’s Warrawoona gold project.
