Precious metals company Sabina Gold and Silver has started drilling at the Goose property, on its Back River gold project, in Nunavut. The 3 500-m spring surface exploration programme will focus on targeting the interface between the planned openpit and the down-plunge zone at Umwelt. This drilling, the company says, will allow for further characterisation of the geology and mineralisation of higher-grade gold zones in those areas which will inform optimisation of the openpit and underground mine designs. Once complete, drilling will move to the Hook zone, which is believed to be part of the gold structure linking the Goose Main and Nuvuyak gold deposits. Drilling is planned to be completed by mid-April. “We look forward to receiving the results of this spring drilling programme as we continue to evolve and develop the resource potential at the 8-km-long Goose gold complex,” says president and CEO Bruce McLeod. “As we have demonstrated in past drilling campaigns, the gold endowment at Goose is exceptional and we remain committed to an exploration and resource growth and optimisation strategy that we believe will add considerable value to the project we progress towards production. With the application of our exploration framework through progressive 3D modeling, integrated data acquisition and drill testing, we are confident that we can continue to demonstrate the significant growth potential and world-class nature of this well-endowed gold project.” Sabina recently filed an updated feasibility study on the Goose mine, which presents a project that will produce about 223 000 oz/y of gold for 15 years with a rapid payback of 2.3 years, with a post-tax internal rate of return of 28% and net present value of C$1.1-billion.
