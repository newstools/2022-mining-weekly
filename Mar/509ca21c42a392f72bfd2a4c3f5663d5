PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Vital Metals will on Friday start share trading on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker VTMXF. Vital told shareholders that its primary listing would remain on the ASX. The company noted that streamlined market standards enable the company to use its ASX reporting, with no additional compliance requirements, and make its information available in the US. The company also confirmed that admission to the OTCQB is non-dilutive because no additional capital is required to be raised and no new shares will be issued in conjunction with inclusion on the OTCQB. Vital recently became Canada’s first rare earth producer following the start of production at its Nechalancho project in June of last year.
