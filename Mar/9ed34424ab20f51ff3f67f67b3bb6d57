Canada-based Kinross Gold has poured the first gold at its La Coipa project, in Chile. The project started commissioning at its plant in early February, with the plant expected to ramp up over the next few months to reach full operating capacity mid-year. “Our team has safely delivered the project on schedule and under budget despite the challenging operating environment caused by the global pandemic over the past two years. With La Coipa expected to reach full operating capacity by mid-year, we are on the cusp of further exciting milestones at the project,” said president and CEO Paul Rollinson. At year-end 2021, Kinross increased La Coipa’s expected life-of-mine (LoM) production by 45% to about one-million gold-equivalent ounces by incorporating the nearby Puren pit into the project and optimising the Phase 7 mine plan. The project’s LoM estimate was also extended from 2024 to 2026. Pre-stripping at Puren is expected to begin in April 2022. The company also noted that it continued to study opportunities to further expand La Coipa’s mine plan, such as a possible additional Puren pushback and incorporating other adjacent pits into the project.
