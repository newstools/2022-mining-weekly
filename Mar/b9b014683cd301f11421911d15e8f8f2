Aim-listed Shanta Gold has announced a maiden mineral resource estimate (MRE) for the Ramula target at the West Kenya project, in Kenya. This follows a successful drilling programme conducted in 2021, with more updates expected on other targets – Isulu-Bushiangala and Bumbo – in coming months. The Ramula target adds 434 400 oz of inferred resources to West Kenya’s total resource, which now stands at 1.6-million ounces – a 36% improvement on the previous MRE. CEO Eric Zurrin says the West Kenya project continues to produce exciting results and the targets reaffirm the project’s potential to be a multimillion-ounce gold district comparable with other prolific greenstone belts in the world. More expansion drilling is planned for the Ramula region, as are metallurgical testing, infill drilling for conversion to mineable resources and a scoping study.
