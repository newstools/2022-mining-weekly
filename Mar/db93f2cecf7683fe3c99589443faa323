Dual-listed Fortuna Silver Mines has announced a maiden inferred mineral resource estimate of 350 000 oz at 3.16 g/t gold at the Sunbird discovery at its Séguéla project, in Côte d´Ivoire. Senior VP of exploration, Paul Weedon, notes that the Sunbird discovery remains open along strike and at depth, providing excellent potential for additional growth based on the ongoing expansion drilling programme under way. “We regard the definition of the Sunbird deposit as a single step in the discovery journey with many more exploration targets identified and yet to be tested,” he says. The inferred resource will not materially change the existing mineral resource estimate at Séguéla or impact on its construction plan, Fortuna notes. The Sunbird deposit is about 1.5 km to the southeast of the Antenna deposit at Séguéla.
