PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior VRX Silica has marked a significant milestone in the development of its Arrowsmith North silica sands project, in Western Australia, with the state’s Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) approving the project’s environmental scoping documents (ESD). The ESD is a precursor to the environmental review document and is required under the EPA’s public environmental review process. “EPA approval of our ESD is the culmination of many months of hard work by both VRX and the EPA and we look forward to continued collaboration as we progress the development of the Arrowsmith North silica sand project,” said VRX MD Bruce Maluish. “The ESD provides the scope of studies required for the next stage of the approvals process, the environmental review document, the draft of which is well advanced, and gives us clarity on the pathway forward to full approval and development of Arrowsmith North. “Arrowsmith North is the first of our three high-quality, world-scale projects and the most advanced pure silica sand development opportunity in Western Australia. I am confident the lessons from this approvals process will assist VRX as we progress approvals and development of the Arrowsmith Central and Muchea silica sand projects. “Based on the indicative timetable now available to the company, VRX expects to begin Arrowsmith North’s six-month construction period in January 2023.” A 2019 bankable feasibility study into the Arrowsmith North project estimated that the two-million-tonne-a-year operation would require a capital investment of A$28.26-million, and would produce 47.7-million tonnes of silica sand over an initial 25-year mine life. The study estimated a post-tax net present value of A$99.8-million and an internal rate of return of 79%.
