Mali's industrial gold mines are expected to produce 64.1 t of gold in 2022, compared to 63.4 t in 2021, the mines ministry said on Thursday. The slight increase is mainly the result of two new small mines, an official at the mines ministry told Reuters. Mali is one of Africa's top gold producers and home to industrial mines operated by companies including Barrick Gold, B2GOLD, Resolute Mining, AngloGold Ashanti and Hummingbird Resources. "In 2022 industrial companies plan to produce 64.12 t, a little more than last year, due among other things to the entry into production of two mines: Bagama Mining SA and Faboula Gold," said Mamadou Sidibe, head of statistics at the ministry. Bagama Mining and Faboula Gold, both privately owned, each produce about 500 kilograms of gold, he said. Barrick Gold, which absorbed Randgold, is by far the largest producer with a forecast of 20.8 t for next year, followed by B2GOLD with 18.2 t and Resolute Mining with 6.8 t, Sidibe said. With production from informal mines estimated at 6 t, total expected gold production for 2022 will be 70.1 t.
