PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Kaolin producer Suvo Strategic Minerals has inked an agreement with Curtin University to investigate the application of high reactivity metakaolin (HRM) as a sustainable solution in decarbonising cement. Research from Curtin University will compare carbon dioxide emission properties of HRM produced from Suvo’s White Cloud kaolin project with other pozzolanics. Under this first phase of research, Curtin University will carry out a comprehensive investigation on the commercial potential of HRM in the concrete industry, including the technical benefits that HRM can provide for concrete materials, especially green concrete. Additionally, the team from Curtin University will investigate the global potential of HRM, document previous studies on the technical benefits and characteristics of HRM, conduct a lifecycle assessment of HRM-based concrete in terms of carbon footprint, emission properties and energy cost savings from a sample of HRM product produced from Suvo’s White Cloud kaolin project in Western Australia The study is expected to demonstrate that the incorporation of HRM is an effective solution to improve the concrete properties and to generate green concretes. Suvo told shareholders on Thursday that the signing of this agreement aligns with Suvo’s strategy to supply minerals critical to decarbonising the global economy.
