Intermediate gold producer B2Gold has announced a significantly increased mineral resource estimate for its Anaconda area, comprising the Menankoto and Bantako North permits, near its Fekola mine, in Mali. The new estimate includes an initial indicated mineral resource of 32.4-million tonnes at 1.08 g/t for a total of 1.13-million ounces, and an inferred mineral resource of 63.7-million tonnes at 1.12 g/t for 2.28-million ounces. B2Gold reported an increase of 1.51-million ounces (196% increase) of inferred resources since the initial estimate in 2017. The company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the Anaconda area could provide selective higher grade saprolite material (average grade of 2.2 g/t) to be trucked to and fed into the Fekola mill, starting as early as late 2022 at a rate of 1.5-million tonnes a year. Subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final development plan, the trucking of selective higher grade saprolite material to the Fekola mill would increase the ore processed and yearly gold production from the Fekola mill, with the potential to add an average of 80 000 oz/y to 100 000 oz/y to the Fekola mill's gold production. B2Gold said the plan to truck the selective higher grade saprolite material was not included in its 2022 production guidance and the Anaconda area mineral resources had not been included in the current Fekola life-of-mine plan. The company has budgeted $33-million to fund development of infrastructure for Phase 1 saprolite mining at Anaconda, including road construction. Based on this updated mineral resource estimate and the 2022 exploration drilling results, the company has started a Phase 2 scoping study to review the project economics of constructing a standalone mill near the Anaconda area.
