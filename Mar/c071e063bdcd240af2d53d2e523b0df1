Critical minerals exploration company NioBay Metals has suspended all exploration activities on the James Bay niobium project, near Moosonee, in Ontario, to consult with the Moose Cree First Nation (MCFN). The company on Thursday received a letter from MCFN, which stated that a survey of the population had indicated an intent to preserve the South Bluff Creek area from any development. That is the area where NioBay’s mining lease for its critical mineral project, the James Bayn, is located and where drilling activities are under way. Based on the results of the survey, the MCFN requested a meeting with NioBay regarding ceasing its permitted exploration. “NioBay has repeatedly stated that it would not build a mine without the consent of the MCFN community. This project is still in the exploration phase and the company does not yet have information as to whether an economic operation may be viable at this location. The company will present the results of its exploration work when this information is available,” it said in a statement. Niobium is a naturally occurring element. It is a readily available, reliable, soft metal that is ductile, malleable and highly resistant to corrosion. Because it enhances properties and functionalities, niobium is used in a wide range of materials and applications in the mobility, structural and energy sectors.
