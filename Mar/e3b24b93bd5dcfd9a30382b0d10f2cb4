London-listed Caracal Gold has appointed Franck Bizouerne as group mineral resource manager, effective April 1. He is a senior geologist with more than 22 years of experience in exploration, particularly with gold, lithium and base metals. Most recently he worked as exploration manager and principal geologist at Rio Tinto’s CBG aluminium mine, in Guinea. Notably, Bizouerne had been involved with developing the Youga gold mine, in Burkina Faso, for Endeavour Mining. He will oversee Caracal’s exploration activities at the Kilimapesa gold mining and processing operation, in Kenya, where two drill rigs are on site to complete a targeted drilling programme to increase resources. Caracal aims to declare a resource of more than 1.5-million ounces. Twenty-seven reverse circulation holes have been drilled for just under 2 500 m so far. Bizouerne will also manage the company’s exploration activities in Tanzania, following the recent acquisition of two gold projects in Lake Victoria Gold Fields.
