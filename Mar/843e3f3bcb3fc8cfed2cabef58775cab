PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Australia-Germany Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator, known as HyGATE, has officially been opened. The federal government last year announced a A$50-million investment into the HyGATE initiative, with the German government committing an additional €50-million. The HyGATE initiative will support real-world pilot, trial and demonstration projects that bring together Australian and German industry and research partners to deliver innovative hydrogen technology projects. Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor said the HyGATE initiative will help to bring the cost of hydrogen down through international collaboration. “This initiative will allow Australia and Germany’s knowledge of advanced technology and skilled workforces to come together on innovative hydrogen projects. It is through these important partnerships and attracting international investment that we will reduce the costs of the low emissions technologies and accelerate their widespread deployment in industry. “A successful hydrogen industry means new energy supply chains, more jobs, and lower emissions across the economy. This is just the next step in maximising this opportunity for Australians.” HyGATE is one of three major initiatives developed as part of the Declaration of Intent between the governments of Australia and Germany on the Australia-Germany Hydrogen Accord, which builds the two nation’s respective strengths, with Australia looking to be a major hydrogen exporter and Germany holding expertise in hydrogen technology and planning to import significant quantities of hydrogen in the future. Australia aims to be a major producer and exporter of clean hydrogen by 2030, and producing clean hydrogen for less than A$2 a kilogram is a priority under the government’s Technology Investment Roadmap.
