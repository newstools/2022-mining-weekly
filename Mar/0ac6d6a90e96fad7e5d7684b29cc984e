Exploration company Sienna Resources has made a new lithium discovery on its Blue Clay project, in Nevada, encountering lithium values as high as 1 230 parts per million (ppm). The discovery was made during its maiden drill programme at Blue Clay, which consists of 150 contiguous claims totalling 1 190 ha prospective for lithium in the Clayton Valley. “Domestically sourced lithium is in massive demand, especially in light of recent global events. We couldn’t be more excited about this new discovery and are immediately planning the next phase of drilling to delineate the lithium held within the property,” said Sienna president Jason Gigliotti. The maiden drilling programme encountered 800 ppm, over 37 m, including 1 011 ppm over 12 m. “When you factor in that lithium prices are at their all-time high today, management is very enthused about this new discovery,” said Gigliotti.
