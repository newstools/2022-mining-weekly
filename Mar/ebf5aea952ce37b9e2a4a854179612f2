PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Origin Energy on Wednesday announced a A$250-million initial on-market share buy-back, starting in April 2022. “Origin is in a strong financial position, with a robust outlook for the business and a capital structure comfortably within our target range. This means we are now in a position to increase shareholder distributions with a share buy-back of A$250-million,” Origin CEO Frank Calabria said. “Going forward, we will continue to balance expected increased cash flow available for shareholder distributions with growth investments. Origin recently completed the sale of a 10% interest in its Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas project to project partner ConocoPhillips.
