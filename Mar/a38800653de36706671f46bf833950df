Diversified miner South32 and its subsidiary Hotazel Manganese Mines has handed over a newly built primary school called Rearata to the Northern Cape Department of Basic Education. The R20-million school is part of South32’s social and labour plan commitments and will enrich the Vergenoeg Village community by providing educational facilities. The school has 14 classrooms to accommodate 500 learners and a dedicated Grade R learning centre. The school also has a library, computer centre and a nutrition block to provide meals for learners. Rearata Primary had been in a state of disrepair prior to the rebuild and previously contained asbestos, which was a health risk to learners and educators. South32 says education is one of four focus areas in its approach to community investment, which all speak to developing sustainable communities for generations to come. The company also has other educational projects in the Northern Cape, including a R3.3-million robotics programme, which has been rolled out at 12 schools in the John Taolo Gaetsewe district. South32 has spent R64-million under its current SLP, which ends in June 2023. In a statement issued by South32, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga acknowledges the value of this investment to learners in the area, saying she appreciates when companies partner to make an impact in communities.
