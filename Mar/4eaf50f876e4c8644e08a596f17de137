Russia’s biggest gold producer, Polyus, has launched a search for potential candidates to fill the roles of independent directors on its board of directors. On March 9, days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Edward Dowling, Maria Gordon, Kent Potter and William Champion resigned from the Polyus board, citing an inability to execute their governance function given the market circumstances. Sergei Nossoff stepped in as chairperson of the board. Polyus said this week that, following the appointment of new directors, the board would consist of at least nine members, the majority of whom would be independent directors. In addition to existing audit, nomination and remuneration, strategy and operations committees, Polyus said it would introduce an ESG committee to the board structure. The objective of the committee would be to consider environmental, social and governance issues relevant for the company and support it in maintaining its position as an ESG leader in the mining industry.
