Integrated primary vanadium producer Bushveld Minerals has appointed Kevin Alcock, Mirco Bardella and Jacqueline Musiitwa to its board as independent nonexecutive directors, with immediate effect. The appointments have been made to ensure the board's composition meets the high standards of corporate governance expected of London-listed companies and reflects Bushveld's status as a significant primary producer of vanadium in South Africa, the company notes. Jeremy Friedlander has retired from Bushveld's board, while chairperson Ian Watson and nonexecutive director Anthony Viljoen intend to retire from the board within the next few months. Watson will not stand for re-election at Bushveld's upcoming annual general meeting and company secretary and nonexecutive director Michael Kirkwood will be appointed acting interim chairperson until a suitable successor is appointed. A formal search for a new chairperson is already under way. Viljoen's retirement will become effective once the onboarding of a fourth independent nonexecutive director has been finalised. "On behalf of the board, I must thank Jeremy for his significant contribution to Bushveld over a decade of service to the company, helping provide vital guidance and leadership as the business rapidly grew from an explorer to one of the most significant primary vanadium producers globally. "It is with great pleasure that I welcome the new directors announced today. I have no doubt these new appointments will help us maintain the strong combination of skills, experience and knowledge that we have always had, not only at board level, but throughout the company," Watson comments.
