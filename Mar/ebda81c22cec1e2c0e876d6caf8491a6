PERTH (miningweekly.com) - Employment in the mining sector has continued to surge, with female participation reaching record levels, up from 19% in November 2021 to 21% in February 2022, the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) said. The industry body noted that the combination of strong demand and need for advanced skills had seen total direct employment reach more than 274 000. This was an increase of 25 000 jobs in the past 12 months and a new record high. “Mining has helped sustain the economy and the budget throughout the pandemic and continues to prepare for the demands of the future world – high tech and lower emissions. The strong labour market has resulted in labour and skills shortages,” MCA CEO Tania Constable said on Friday. “To sustain the economic recovery, the MCA calls on the government to increase investment in skills and training. “Mining has supported more than 5 000 new apprenticeships in the last 12 months. The Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements program has been instrumental to increasing apprenticeships in the mining supply chain. “Next week, the Federal Government has an opportunity to continue this program to support even more apprenticeships. There has never been a better time to join Australia’s mining industry,” she added.
