Diversified miner Anglo American has announced the sale of the group’s remaining 8% shareholding in coal miner Thungela Resources for R1.6-billion. The transaction was done by way of an accelerated bookbuild placing to a number of major financial institutions. The Thungela shares were placed at a price of R154 apiece. Anglo has been gradually disposing of its remaining interest in Thungela since demerging the company in June last year, in efforts to divest from coal mining operations.
