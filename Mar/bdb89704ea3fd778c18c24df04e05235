PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Core Lithium on Friday announced that foundation MD Stephen Biggins had resigned from the company, and would step down before the end of 2022. Biggins retires from the company for personal reasons. “After nearly 12 years with Core, I am proud of the contribution I have made to the discovery and development of the Finniss lithium project and growing the company to become Australia’s next lithium producer,” Biggins said. “Core is in perfect position to reach its next stage of growth as a lithium producer, and I feel it is the right time to step down as MD and pass the torch on to the right person to lead Core in this next stage. “Our transformation from explorer to producer is progressing to plan, the financial performance is strong, and at the Finniss lithium project, we have built a platform for sustainable growth for many years to come.” The board has appointed Korn Ferry to commence a thorough and competitive executive search for a new CEO.
