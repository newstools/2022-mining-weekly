TSX-listed Ivanhoe Mines’ 39.6%-owned Kamoa-Kakula joint venture mining complex, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, produced 105 884 t of copper concentrate in 2021, exceeding even the upwards revised guidance range of between 92 500 t and 100 000 t for the year. The project’s copper recoveries increased from an average of 81% in July 2021 to a record 88.5% in December 2021. Kamoa-Kakula’s Phase 1 concentrator plant is on track to begin operating in April, which will see a doubling of nameplate milling capacity throughput to 7.6-million tonnes of ore a year. Ivanhoe continues to progress a copper exploration programme on the Western Foreland licences in close proximity to Kamoa-Kakula.
