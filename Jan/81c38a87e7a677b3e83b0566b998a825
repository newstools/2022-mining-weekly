Twelve locally manufactured B45E articulated dump trucks (ADTs) were recently handed over to locally-owned and -operated miner Alfieri Holdings, which operates Ikoti Coal, in Mpumalanga. These ADTs, industry cluster organisation Mining Equipment Manufacturers of South Africa (Memsa) says, are the lowest cost per tonne ADT in the 40 t to 45 t class, “making it well-suited for coal mining applications”. The ADTs are locally manufactured at machine industry company Bell Equipment’s factory in Richards Bay, and will be used in the coal sector around the Breyten area, providing meaningful jobs in the area. While the number of attendees to the December handover event were restricted owing to Covid restrictions and protocols, representatives from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) were in attendance. DMRE director-general Advocate Thabo Mokoena, and the DTIC’s Shawn Moses and Mzwakhe Mbatha collectively agreed that the government was supporting industry through the industry master plans. Bell Equipment chairperson Gary Bell, meanwhile, said more can be achieved by working together, while Memsa CEO Lehlohonolo Molloyi highlighted that the industry body was “committed to support members’ initiatives”. He added that “the more we innovate, the more we can create jobs”. Memsa further thanked the department for its participation in the event, noting that this was done in support of a local South African mining equipment manufacturing company. “Their support as key stakeholder in mining supply chain will be greatly valued. Memsa remains a voice for Proudly South African companies that work hard to positively impact on the national economy through manufacturing, job creation and skills development, which is in line with various government policies and its drive to support local content,” the organisation said.
