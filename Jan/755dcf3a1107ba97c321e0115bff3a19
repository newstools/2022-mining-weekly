Dual-listed Aura Energy has appointed Dr Will Goodall as acting CEO, to fulfil the roles and responsibilities of the previous CEO until the company appoints a board-level MD and CEO during the first half of this year. Goodall will attend board meetings during this time and will continue to drive Aura towards expanding the Tiris uranium resource and preparing the company for production of uranium at its flagship Tiris project in Mauritania. Following the resolutions passed at the company's annual general meeting on December 21, 2021, Aura has undergone a strategic board restructure to advance the company from a uranium explorer to a uranium producer. As part of this restructure, Phil Mitchell was appointed nonexecutive chairperson, with Warren Mundine and Bryan Dixon appointed nonexecutive directors. With the newly appointed, production-focused board of directors, Peter Reeve stepped down as the company's MD and CEO to apply his exploration experience to advancing Aura's gold assets, held by Achaean Greenstone Gold, with the aim of creating further value for Aura shareholders "I am pleased to take on the role of acting CEO of Aura. I look forward to leveraging the strengths and leadership of the current team to drive the company in expanding our uranium resources and advancing Tiris towards uranium production. “Having worked with Aura for over ten years and being responsible for delivery of the Tiris scoping and definitive feasibility studies, I see the project as an exciting opportunity for Aura to move rapidly into uranium production. The Aura team has done a great job to prepare the Tiris project, with simple mining and metallurgy leading to low capital and operating costs,” Goodall says. Goodall holds a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering and PhD (Chemical Engineering), and has over 20 years of experience in geometallurgy, mineral processing and hydrometallurgy across a range of commodities.
