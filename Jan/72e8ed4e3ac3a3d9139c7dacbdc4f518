Angola’s national diamond trading company Sodiam has completed the process of evaluating expressions of interest from both Angolan and international companies for the provision of specialised services, including diamond boiling and diamond tenders – services deemed important for the future Angolan diamond exchange. The results of the evaluation process determined that South African and Belgian diamond services company First Element would be selected as the diamond boiling unit, while diamond trader Trans Atlantic Gems Sales would handle diamond tenders. Trans Atlantic Gems Sales is based in both South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. The evaluation process began in May 2021. Sodiam chairperson Eugenio Bravo da Rosa on January 20 said the process “reinforces Angola's and Sodiam’s commitment to the transparency in the scope of the ongoing reforms in the diamond subsector, as well as in the introduction of new dynamics, functionalities and technologies, with international excellence standards, which will add value to the diamond trading system through the future Angola diamond exchange”.
