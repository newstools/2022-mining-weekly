PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Vimy Resources has appointed Tony Chamberlain as COO. Chamberlain first joined Vimy as an executive in 2014, where he successfully took the Mulga Rock uranium project, in Western Australia, from concept to a definitive feasibility study (DFS). During this time, he led the overall management of environmental approvals for Mulga Rock, which saw the project obtain ministerial approval in December 2016. He was also instrumental in negotiating and acquiring the world-class Alligator River project from Cameco in March 2018. Chamberlain joined the Vimy board as a nonexecutive director in February 2019. Since 2019, he has been the project director and COO at BCI Minerals, where he led the DFS and optimised bankable feasibility studies for the Mardie salt and potash project and led the project through banking due diligence. Chamberlain will start his executive role at the start of February and step down from the Vimy board once a suitable replacement is found. Vimy is aiming to complete a bankable feasibility study for Mulga Rock this year along with progressing project financing activities and continuing early works. Planning has also commenced on a resource extension drilling programme at the Angulari deposit located in the Alligator River project.
