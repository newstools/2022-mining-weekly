PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Stanmore Coal has awarded a A$564-million mining contract at its Isaac Downs mine, in Queensland. The five-year opencut mining services contract was awarded to EPSA Pacific, marking a major milestone in moving the mine to full production, following the completion of all regulatory approvals in the third quarter of last year. Stanmore told shareholders that mining activities under the new contract would start in the second quarter of 2022, with the company moving to an owner-operator model for the coal handling and preparation plant. The new model is expected to provide operational flexibility, allowing Stanmore to capture additional value while navigating market conditions, the company said. The mine is forecast to produce up to 2.5-million tonnes a year of metallurgical coal for up to 10 years.
