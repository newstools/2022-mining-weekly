PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has reported a 5% increase in gold production for the quarter ended December, compared with the September quarter, with full-year production reaching guidance. Gold production in the three months to December reached 79 816 oz, with full-year production reported at 319 271 oz, within the guidance of between 315 000 oz and 340 000 oz previously set. The ASX- and LSE-listed Resolute told shareholders on Thursday that increased gold production in the December quarter reflected improved performance from both the Syama oxide and Mako operations, in Mali and Senegal respectively, which produced 15% and 17% more gold than the previous quarter. Sulphide production from Sayama was 10% lower than the September quarter, with the operation affected by mechanical downtime and a seven-day planned shutdown of the milling circuit. Resolute told shareholders on Thursday that the company was continuing to monitor developments in Mali following the imposition of sanctions by the Economic Community of West African States on Mali in January this year. Operations at Sayama are continuing as normal, with no current impact on production, supply or employees and contractor’s safety and security. Looking ahead at 2022, Resolute has set a production guidance of 345 000 oz, at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1 425/oz, inclusive of corporate overheads. The AISC expectations were up from the $1 370/oz reported for the 2021 calendar year, reflecting the impacts of a planned 35-day shutdown of the sulphide operation in February and the completion of the Mako cutback.
