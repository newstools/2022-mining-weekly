Exploration works at investment company Eastinco Mining and Exploration’s joint venture (JV) project in southern Rwanda have, so far, confirmed the company’s expectation that the area could evolve into “an exciting exploration play” that will bolster its Rwanda-based asset portfolio and add value to the company and its shareholders, says chairperson Charles Bay. A geochemical soil sampling programme at the HCK JV licence, in which HCK Mining holds 30% and Eastinco 70%, has covered 50% of the licence. Eleven new pegmatite zones have been identified during field traversing, of which two possibly indicate strike extensions to the existing known pegmatite zones. “The discovery of nine new and potentially tantalum/niobium-bearing zones is very exciting, especially considering we have only covered 50% of the licence area as a first pass,” Bay says.
