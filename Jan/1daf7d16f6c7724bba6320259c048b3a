PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) has welcomed the state government’s proposal to investigate potential gas pipeline pathways and optimisation of the Bowen basin’s gas reserves to support the East Coast gas market for export and domestic use. The state government last week announced a concept study into the Bowen basin pipeline, which would also investigate opportunities to capture fugitive emissions from underground and opencut coal mines in the Bowen basin to assist in Queensland’s efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said on Thursday that the state government’s release of its Bowen basin pipeline concept study followed six months of industry consultation, after the QRC and Association of Mining and Exploration Companies secured an election commitment to assess the feasibility of building a new gas pipeline in the Bowen basin. "Building a pipeline in the Bowen basin could provide a much better connection from the region’s gas reservoirs to Queensland’s gas markets and deliver a welcome increase in gas supply,” Macfarlane said. “Gas is an essential input for refining and smelting, so this pipeline could also add value to Queensland’s metals exports, and deliver improved environmental outcomes through better use of waste gas from existing coal mines, which will help lower emissions. “The QRC is delighted to see infrastructure like this under consideration, and we welcome the state government’s commitment to work collaboratively with the Commonwealth in funding this important scoping study. “If the pipeline proceeded it would provide new jobs and opportunities for Queenslanders, particularly in the regions, and would help our state recover from the long-term impact of the pandemic on the economy.”
