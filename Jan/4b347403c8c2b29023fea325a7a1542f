TSX-V-listed Aton Resources has recorded first assay results from the Phase 2 diamond drilling programme at its Rodruin gold exploration project. Interim CEO Tonno Vahk says these results clearly indicate the potential for a large openpittable oxide gold resource at Rodruin, with the identification of broad zones of near-surface mineralisation. Rodruin is located in the company's 100%-owned Abu Marawat concession in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The first ten drill holes for the programme have been completed to date, ROD-051 to ROD-060, for a total of 1 078 m drilled. All holes so far have been drilled horizontally or at shallow angles in areas of rugged terrain, to test for potential near-surface mineralisation amenable to openpit mining methods. Results are now available from the first three holes that have been completed. Intersections from the first three diamond drill holes at Rodruin represent near-surface extensions of mineralisation outcropping at surface, which will be easily exploitable by openpit mining. “We are very pleased with the results from the first three diamond drill holes at Rodruin, and this is just the start of what we are sure will be a very successful programme,” says Vahk. He says that, as this programme proceeds over the coming months, Aton fully expects to be making rapid progress towards the identification, delineation and development of a very significant oxide gold resource at Rodruin. Moreover, as its geological understanding of the structural framework improves, the company also expects to be able to unlock the full potential of the primary sulphide mineralisation first identified in the 2018 reverse circulation drilling programme. “We firmly believe that we will be making great strides in 2022, and we are very much looking forward to working with our partners at the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority towards developing new gold mines at both Rodruin and Hamama West,” Vahk acclaims.
