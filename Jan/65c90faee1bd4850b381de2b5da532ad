PERTH (miningweekly.com) - ASX-listed junior Austral Resources has started bulk mining operations at its Anthill copper project, in Queensland. Ore mining is expected to start in April, Austral told shareholders on Tuesday. "The Anthill mine is a hive of activity with two blast rigs working ahead of the mining fleet to deliver broken ground. Clearing is nearing completion over the two pits, dewatering and monitoring bores are being installed, and topsoil is being stockpiled for future rehabilitation," said Austral CEO Steve Tambanis. "Our Mount Kelly processing facility is being prepared to accept Anthill ore with the crushing and stacking circuit refurbishment 70% complete. The electrowinning circuit is being prepared to produce in excess of 1 000 t/m of copper cathode. We have 100 personnel on-site to undertake the Anthill mine development and plant refurbishment prior to ore deliveries from April this year." Tambanis said that multiple mining contractors were working to assist Austral achieve planned copper production of 10 000 t/y, starting in mid-2022. Furthermore, exploration and development activities are currently being expanded with the goal of fast-tracking discoveries.
