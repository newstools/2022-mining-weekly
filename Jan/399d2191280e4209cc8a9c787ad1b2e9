Energy tech company Foremost Lithium Resource & Technology has received a permit from the Province of Manitoba to extract a bulk sample from its Zoro lithium project located in the historic mining district of Snow Lake. Foremost Lithium plans to extract a 500 kg bulk sample of spodumene-bearing pegmatite from Dyke 1 on Zoro. The bulk sample will be shipped to a reputable third party for metallurgical testing and process development. A 2020 peer reviewed technical publication co-authored with SGS Mineral Services concluded that spodumene-bearing pegmatite from Zoro’s Dyke 1 can be processed using industry standard metallurgy to produce a 6% battery-grade lithium concentrate. The goal for the upcoming 500 kg bulk sample is to demonstrate that pegmatite from Zoro is suitable to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide, thereby making it viable for Foremost to market its lithium to strategic partners prior to development.
