London-listed Blencowe Resources has appointed Australian engineering firm Battery Limits to assist it in the completion of a prefeasibility study (PFS) for its Orom-Cross graphite project in Uganda. Battery Limits has completed feasibility studies for several tier-one graphite projects internationally and it has extensive graphite project experience in East Africa, Blencowe points out. Blencowe considers this previous project experience, and in particular the East African graphite knowledge, highly beneficial to Battery Limits assisting in the development of the Orom-Cross project. Battery Limits will lead the PFS and will, ultimately, sign off on the study, which Blencowe says will provide credibility to all parties concerned. Study aspects of process engineering and process plant design, capital and operating cost estimates, management of ongoing metallurgical testwork, infrastructure and project implementation will all be undertaken by Battery Limits. Specialised subconsultants in Uganda and South Africa will also assist with tailings storage design and geotechnical and hydrological studies, under supervision of Battery Limits. "We are both pleased and privileged to have a technical partner with the capabilities and experience of Battery Limits helping us to deliver the PFS, due for completion around mid-2022. “Our Orom-Cross graphite project continues to move towards first production in the medium term and their involvement will help provide a stronger operational and commercial model,” executive chairperson Cameron Pearce says.
