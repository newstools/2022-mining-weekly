Aim-listed Anglo Asian Mining has completed its strategic 19.8% investment in TSX-V-listed Libero Copper and Gold, in line with its strategy to expand its interests in Azerbaijan and internationally. Anglo Asian acquired the interest in Libero for $6.3-million. The initial 9.8% was acquired upon closing of a subscription agreement in December and the remaining 10% was acquired following regulatory approval. Libero will use the funds invested by Anglo Asian for exploration in Colombia, with a drilling contract recently signed for 5 000 m of drilling.
