Aim- and BSE-listed Botswana Diamonds has completed a preliminary kimberlite assessment on its Thorny River diamond prospect in South Africa, with the projected kimberlite volume now considerably higher than previous estimates at about two-million tonnes. “The estimated kimberlite volume in the River area is considerably better than expected. Botswana Diamonds will now determine the mining potential. Let me put this in context. The two-million tonnes is almost twice the size of the nearby Marsfontein deposit. “We have identified other small potential blows which could further increase the kimberlite volume. This enhances the potential in developing a “hub and spoke” mining project,” says chairperson John Teeling. An economic study of mining options has been initiated. No assessment of potential diamond grade has been made at this stage. Elsewhere on the Thorny River property, four further potential blow targets have been identified – there is thus potential to further increase kimberlite volume.
