Americas-focused explorer Solaris Resources on Tuesday announced a significant new discovery in maiden drilling of the Warintza South target at its Warintza project, in Ecuador. Its first hole drilled at Warintza South – an entirely separate porphyry deposit 3 km south of the Warintza central zone – returned 606 m of 0.41% copper-equivalent of continuous porphyry copper mineralisation from near surface, within a broader interval of 755 m of 0.36% copper-equivalent. This, the company said, marked a significant new discovery on the project. “The multi-kilometre dimensions of the target present a large-scale opportunity. Interpretation of the drill core together with recent mapping and sampling provide important vectors for follow-up drilling to be completed once additional access and infrastructure are established,” said VP of exploration Jorge Fierro. Solaris noted that Warintza South was the fourth major copper discovery within the 7 km by 5 km Warintza porphyry cluster, with the adjacent Yawi and Caya targets still to be tested.
