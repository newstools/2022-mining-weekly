PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Artemis Resources will raise A$9.5-million in a share placement to institutional and sophisticated investors to fund its dual listing on the Aim, in London. The company on Thursday said that it would place more than 133.33-million shares, at a price of 7.1c each. “It is an historical quirk that the discovery of what I believe to be one of the most important Australian gold/copper discoveries in the last 25 years at Havieron was made by an Aim-listed UK explorer. As such, the enormous stock market interest in this fantastic discovery has been largely played out on the London Stock Exchange. With a 30% interest in the Havieron joint venture with Newcrest Mining, Greatland Gold is currently valued at A$1-billion,” said Artemis executive director Alastair Clayton. He noted that by dual listing on the Aim, Artemis is hoping to tap into this pool of shareholder interest and understanding to complement its primary listing on the ASX. Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of 1.38-billion ordinary shares to trade on the Aim, with admission expected on February 7. With the capital raising, Artemis will be fully funded to execute its drill programme at its Paterson Central and Greater Carlow/Radio Hill gold/copper projects, in Western Australia.
