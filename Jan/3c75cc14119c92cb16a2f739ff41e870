TSX-listed mineral explorer and developer Osisko Mining has appointed Pascal Simard as exploration VP in charge of managing all exploration activities of the corporation. He joined Osisko Mining in 2016 and was most recently exploration director – a position in which he contributed to the development of the company’s project portfolio, including Windfall and regional exploration on Urban-Barry in search of gold deposits. A graduate from Université du Québec à Chicoutimi with a Bachelor in geological engineering, Simard is a professional engineer with over 17 years of experience on exploration and mining projects in Canada, and is a member of the Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec. Prior to joining Osisko, he worked with Virginia Mines and Cambior on projects in the Abitibi, James-Bay and Northern Quebec. Osisko Mining CEO and chairperson John Burzynski says, “we expect him to have a very busy 2022 as we move to complete feasibility work on our flagship Windfall deposit and begin to turn our attention to making new discoveries on our vast Urban Barry-Quévillon land package.”
