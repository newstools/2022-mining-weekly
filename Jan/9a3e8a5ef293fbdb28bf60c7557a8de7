PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed EcoGraf on Tuesday reported the production of its first GreenRECARB products as part of its global product development programme for the new EcoGraf battery anode material (BAM) facility, in Western Australia. GreenRECARB is a recarburiser additive for use in electric arc and induction furnace steel manufacturing processes, with the products achieving specifications required for use as an environmentally superior replacement for petroleum coke furnace additives by global steel manufacturers. EcoGraf said on Tuesday that the initial phase of the GreenRECARB programme consisted of bench-scale formulation of optimum binding, granulation and pelletisation processes to produce a cost-effective and environmentally superior recarburiser product for steel manufacturers. The BAM facility will eventually manufacture spherical graphite products for export to Asia, Europe and North America using an HFfree purification technology to provide customers with sustainably produced high-performance battery anode material. Subsequently, the battery graphite production base will be expanded to include additional processing facilities in Europe and North America to support the global transition to clean, renewable energy in the coming decade and the rapid growth in battery materials. To complement its battery graphite operations, EcoGraf is also advancing its Epanko graphite project, in Tanzania, which will supply additional feedstock for the battery anode material facilities and provide customers with a long-term supply of high-quality graphite products for industrial applications such as refractories, recarburisers and lubricants.
