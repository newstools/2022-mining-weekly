The PureGold mine, in Red Lake, Ontario, is operating at a “slightly reduced rate”, as the company implemented measures in response to an increasing number of positive Covid-19 cases at the mine site over the last several days. TSX-V- and LSE-listed Pure Gold Mining reported on Tuesday that its administrative staff members were working remotely and that its onsite workforce had been reduced to essential workers only. “While the ultimate impact on monthly, or quarterly production, if any, is not yet known, the company expects to make up any production shortfall shortly after returning to full production,” Pure Gold said in a statement. The company last week stated that the mine would target production in the range of 600 t/d to 700 t/d (60% to 70% of mill capacity) for the first quarter of 2022 and would ramp up gradually from there as access to high-confidence, high-grade stopes increased. Pure Gold also last week announced that mining engineer Troy Fierro had replaced Darin Labrenz as president and CEO and that business development VP Chris Haubrich had replaced Sean Tetzlaff as CFO.
