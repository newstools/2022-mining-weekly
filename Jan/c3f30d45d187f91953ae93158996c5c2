Gold miner Caledonia mining, which operates the Blanket mine, in Zimbabwe, has appointed Dana Roets as director, with immediate effect. Dana has been the COO of Caledonia since 2013 and will continue in this role following his appointment to the board. He is a qualified engineer with over 34 years of operational and managerial experience in the South African gold and platinum industries. He has held various operational roles, from being an underground miner to VP and head of operations at the Kloof mine. "I am delighted to welcome our colleague Dana onto the board. He is a highly respected professional engineer with a long record in the mining industry. His contribution to Caledonia as COO over the last nine years has been outstanding - in particular, his contribution to the successful implementation of the Central Shaft project at Blanket Mine. Dana was responsible for this project from its initial design stage in late 2014 to its commissioning in March 2021. "Over this period, Blanket's production has increased by over 60% from less than 42 000 oz of gold in 2014 to over 67 000 oz of gold in 2021. Following the successful completion of the Central Shaft, we anticipate production at Blanket mine increasing further to approximately 80 000 oz/y from 2022 onwards. "Under Dana's leadership, Caledonia's technical team has been substantially strengthened, which puts us in a good position to embark on new projects which I expect will be an integral part in achieving the board's strategic vision for the company to become a multi-asset gold producer," comments Caledonia chairperson Leigh Wilson. "I am very excited to be appointed to the board at such a transformational time for the company and to become more closely involved with the strategic decision-making process, especially in the company's transition into a multi-asset gold producer," Roets adds.
