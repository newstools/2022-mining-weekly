Toronto-based Innovation Metals Corporation (IMC) says commissioning of its demonstration-scale rare earth separation and purification pilot plant, in Ontario, will start in the first quarter of this year. This follows the company undertaking extensive process and hardware design activities during 2021, and subsequent construction activities underway for the demo plant. The facility will be used to verify the commercial viability of IMC’s RapidSX technology. The company anticipates that its technology will be ready for commercial adoption and implementation by customers by the end of 2022. IMC will secure customers through revenue-producing licensing agreements. “Interest in the RapidSX technology for the separation of rare earth elements and other critical metals is as strong as ever, and we continue to actively engage and to progress discussions with a number of third parties,” says CEO and co-founder Dr Gareth Hatch.
