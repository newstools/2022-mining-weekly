Mines owned and operated by Canadian mining companies in Burkina Faso are continuing to operate unaffected by the political situation in that country. Iamgold said that the supply chains for its Essakane mine, located about 330 km from the capital Ouagadougou, had not been impacted by developments in Burkina Faso. On Monday, the military seized power, ousting President Roch Kabore – the fourth coup in West Africa in the last 17 months. Endeavour Mining and Fortuna Silver Mines also stated that their respective operations remained unaffected and continued to operate as usual. Endeavour owns the Hounde mine and Fortuna the Yaramoko gold mine.
