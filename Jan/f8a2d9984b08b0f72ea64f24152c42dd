TSX-V-listed Adventus Mining Corporation now owns 75% of the Curipamba copper/gold project, in Ecuador. This follows earn-in completions for Salazar Resources and the companies will now manage their respective rights and obligations of the incorporated joint venture company that controls and owns the project. Adventus has spent earn-in expenditures of $44.1-million on the project up to September 30, 2021. The company continues advancing discussions with potential financing partners for the capital to develop Curipamba. Adventus will start with detailed engineering, hiring of key construction personnel and completion of the investment agreement with the government of Ecuador, before the end of the first quarter this year. The Ecuador government is, meanwhile, reviewing the project’s environmental- and social-impact assessment.
