Digital reality solutions provider Hexagon’s Mining division has completed a safety installation with miner Gold Fields Ghana. About 35 mine vehicles were equipped with Hexagon’s Operator Alertness System Heavy Vehicle (OAS-HV) at the Damang mine in Ghana’s western region. After a successful pilot project completed in late 2020 and early 2021, full deployment of OAS-HV proceeded smoothly despite ongoing Covid-19 travel restrictions, Hexagon notes. The recent opening of Hexagon’s Accra office and its staff of engineers and project managers ensured full collaboration with Gold Fields’ teams, resulting in a high-quality project delivered on time and within budget, it adds. The operator alertness system responds to the threat posed by fatigue and distraction, helping operators of heavy and light machinery to maintain the level of attention necessary for long hours and sometimes monotonous tasks. For Gold Fields, OAS-HV is one more way to ensure that people working at the busy openpit mine return home safely after every shift, Hexagon states. “More than 60% of our employees are from the host communities. “Hexagon’s Operator Alertness System is not only ensuring worker safety, but also enhancing our reputation as a responsible mining company that prioritises the health and safety of its employees,” says Damang mine community affairs manager Abdel-Razak Yakubu.
