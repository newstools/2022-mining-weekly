Emerald mining company Kagem Mining has signed a collective agreement with unions, which will result in employees receiving a 10% increase in basic salary for this year, followed by a further 10% increase for 2023 across the board. The collective agreement follows negotiations between management and representatives of the Mine Workers Union of Zambia and the National Union of Miners and Allied Workers. The parties also agreed on a company pension contribution increase from 20% to 25% of basic pay, bringing the effective salary increase of unionised employees to 15% for 2022 and 2023, and the overall increase to 22.5% over the next two years. Kagem Mines, which is 75% owned by London-listed Gemfields, operates the Kagem emerald mine, in Zambia’s Lufwanyama district. Kagem GM Sanjeev Kumar says the agreement will provide workers with improved living standards and greater job security. “Together we will strive to achieve our strategic and commercial goals and remain a world-leading supplier of emeralds,” he adds.
