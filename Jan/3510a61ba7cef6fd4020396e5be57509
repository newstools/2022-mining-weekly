West Africa-focused gold company Cora Gold has made progress with its environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities in Mali, including the appointment of dedicated ESG personnel, as its Sanankoro gold project moves towards the completion of a definitive feasibility study. Cora has appointed Djibril Sanogo as ESG manager to coordinate ESG commitments going forward, and to oversee the completion of the Sanankoro environmental- and social-impact assessment. Further, Dr Pete Whitbread-Abrutat has been appointed as ESG adviser to the company. “The appointment of two ESG personnel to direct and uphold our ESG responsibilities is a big step forward for Cora and reflects our commitment to setting a benchmark for the responsible development of a gold mine at Sanankoro in the future. “I am delighted to welcome Djibril as our ESG manager. He comes with a wealth of experience, having worked on operational gold mines in Mali throughout his career and will be a critical team member on site at Sanankoro, overseeing all of our various initiatives and maintaining our positive relationships with the surrounding communities. “Furthermore, Pete’s . . . expertise in sustainability will offer a huge support to Cora as we move forward,” Cora CEO Bert Monro says. Cora also notes that there has been continued positive engagement with local communities as development activities intensify at Sanankoro. The miner has completed a new water well at the Dako community village garden and provided garden equipment to the Faragouagnia community. Moreover, a solar kit and battery has been supplied to the Sanankoro village community, while a contribution was made towards the health centre, the company highlights.
