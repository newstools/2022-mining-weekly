Copper and gold miner Rambler Metals and Mining says production at its Ming mine, in Newfoundland and Labrador, will be negatively affected by a shortage of contract operators. There has been a substantial rise in Covid-19 in Newfoundland. As a precaution against the transmission of Covid-19, a number of critical operators have been in isolation since December 31 and, therefore, unable to attend the mine site due to a positive PCR test result received prior to reaching the mine site. In this instance, it is fly-in contract operators that are in isolation, which is anticipated to be for up to 14 days. The shortage of contract operators, who are focused on mine development, means that the mine cannot develop at target rates until the isolation period is over or replacement contractors arrive. Therefore, the time required to develop sufficiently to sustain the company's production target of 1 350 t/d of ore will be impacted and, accordingly, production guidance is now expected to be delayed further into the first quarter of this year.
