Aim-listed Oriole Resources says the results of a soil sampling programme at its 90%-owned Bibemi gold project, in Cameroon, have returned up to 271 parts per billion gold and confirmed the continuity of the Bakassi Zone 1 prospect by 3 km. Soil sampling was completed for 1 455 samples over the southern half of Bibemi, extending and infilling historical regional sampling grids. Bibemi now has a confirmed strike length of almost 12 km at surface. The results from a Phase 3 diamond drilling programme at Bakassi Zone 1 are expected later this quarter.
