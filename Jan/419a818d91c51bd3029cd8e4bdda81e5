Natural resource development company Red Rock Resources has announced encouraging results from the first batch of 950 samples from its recently completed 2021 Phase 1 reverse circulation (RC) drilling exploration programme in the mid-KKM prospect at the Mikei gold project (MGP) in Kenya. Chairperson Andrew Bell says the first nine holes were extremely encouraging, and take the company some way towards its objectives for the programme. Seven of the drill holes intercepted gold mineralisation, including five at good grades, he highlights. A total of 20 drill holes, totalling 2 093 m, were completed as part of the Phase 1 RC drilling programme. Sampling and logging was done at 1 m intervals by the company’s in-house geological team prior to being sent to SGS in Mwanza, Tanzania, for accredited laboratory assay. "The drill programme was designed to test possible extensions of the mineralised zones and to infill some possible gaps where holes might previously have been drilled too far apart to allow an assumption of continuity of mineralisation in the resource calculation. “A more powerful compressor had to be brought in part way through the programme, and the first nine holes for which we have results were those drilled while waiting for it to arrive. A comprehensive picture of the results of the programme awaits the results of the final eleven holes, including some deeper holes,” Bell says.
