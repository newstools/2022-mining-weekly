Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has sold a 6.8 ct diamond recovered from its Kareevlei mine in South Africa for $63 186 in its January sale. "We recently announced we had two potentially high-value stones to sell in the January tender and, although one fell under our $50 000 disclosure threshold, we are delighted to have sold a 6.8 ct stone for $63 186. “What was particularly encouraging was the average price of $565/ct achieved for the total January tender – a reflection of the continued overall quality of Kareevlei diamonds and the strong market demand seen so far in 2022,” executive chairperson Mike Houston acclaims.
