PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Kairos Minerals has raised A$7.1-million through the exercise of options to fund gold and lithium exploration in Western Australia. The company on Thursday announced that it had exercised more than 285.2-million options, at a price of 2.5c each. “The success of the option exercise and underwriting leaves Kairos with a very healthy cash position to pursue our exploration objectives over the year ahead. Building on the high-quality work completed last year, we are ready to hit the ground running in 2022 to test a range of high-priority gold and lithium targets and strive for the breakthrough discovery we are all working towards,” said executive chairperson Terry Topping. “With the recent exciting discovery of extensive lithium pegmatite targets and the Steamboat gold prospect outside of the current 873 500 oz mineral resource inventory at Mt York and the ramp-up of exploration for gold and lithium targets across our prospective Pilbara tenement package, we are gearing up for another very active exploration season.”
