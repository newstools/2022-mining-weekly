PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Sayona Mining has acquired 121 new claims west of the Moblan lithium project, significantly expanding the footprint of its Northern Québec lithium hub. Located 3.5 km west of the Moblan project, the new claims, known as the Lac Albert project, span 6 592 ha and will be assessed for lithium pegmatite occurrences during the upcoming northern hemisphere summer. The Moblan project covers around 433 ha for a total of 20 claims, with Sayona holding a 60% interest. The new claims are separate to the current Moblan joint venture agreement. “Moblan and Lac Albert are located in a proven lithium mining district, with potential to become a significant northern growth hub for Sayona, adding to our Abitibi lithium hub in the south,” said Sayona MD Brett Lynch. The Moblan deposit is host to spodumene pegmatite mineralisation and the additional claims at Lac Albert are located in the same proven lithium mining province, Eeyou‐Istchee James Bay, which hosts established lithium resources such as Nemaska Lithium’s Whabouchi mine. It is well serviced by key infrastructure and transport, namely the Route de Nord, and has access to low-cost, environment-friendly hydropower. Drilling is currently under way at Moblan in partnership with SOQUEM Inc, acting as operator. The planned 55 diamond drill hole programme for nearly 9 000 m aims to identify extensions to the Moblan deposit and define mineralisation in nearby spodumene pegmatites, such as the Moléon prospect. “The drilling programme shows our commitment to further expanding our lithium resource base, further solidifying Sayona’s leading position in the North American lithium sector,” said Lynch.
