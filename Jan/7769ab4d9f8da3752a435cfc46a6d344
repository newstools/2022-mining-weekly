PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Northern Minerals has paused the feasibility study for a full-scale beneficiation plant at its Browns Range rare earths project, in Western Australia, as it undertakes a company-wide strategic review. The company on Thursday told shareholders that newly appointed chairperson Nick Curtis will undertake the review of the company’s strategy, which will also include a review of the feasibility study into a full-scale benefication plant at Browns Range. Northern Minerals noted that work would be slowed down during the three-month review period to ensure that the company’s resources were focused on supporting the right strategy. The company in late 2018 started the production of heavy rare earth carbonate at the Browns Range pilot plant as part of a three-year pilot assessment of the economic and technical feasibility of a larger scale development at Browns Range. The company will be completing the three-year test programme on the pilot plant at Browns Range during the March 2022 quarter, and the results of these test programmes, including results from the ore sorter, will be used and updated when the feasibility study is restarted. The pilot plant will be put on care and maintenance.
