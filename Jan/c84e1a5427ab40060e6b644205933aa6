PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Australian companies operating in Burkina Faso are continuing to operate unabated, despite political unrest. Reports have emerged that the military seized power and overthrew President Roch Kaboré. Gold miner West African Resources said on Tuesday that the company’s staff and contractors remained safe, and that the Sanbrado operations continued to operate as usual. However, the miner said that it would continue to monitor the current political situation in the country. ASX-listed mining services provider Perenti Global also noted that all of its operations continued as usual, and that staff were safe and accounted for. “Perenti has over 30 years experience operating in West Africa and we continue to work closely with our clients and advisers to ensure the safety of our people and operational continuity,” the company said in a statement.
