London-listed explorer Kavango Resources has recommenced with drilling of the KSZDD002 hole at its Kalahrai Suture Zone project in Botswana, following a pause over the December holidays whereby the hole was sealed off at 350 m. On January 14, Mindea Exploration and Drilling mobilised the rig and drill team back to the site, successfully removing the hole casing that was left in the hole prior to Christmas to keep KSZDD002 open. Drilling is scheduled to commence during a day shift on January 17, with operations to continue on a double shift until completion. KSZDD002 has been designed to intercept the B1 conductor – a geophysical anomaly that Kavango believes is a prospective target for possible massive sulphide nickel or copper mineralisation. Drilling of KSZDD002 is targeting an intercept depth of between 525 m and 575 m for the B1 conductor. Kavango first identified the B1 conductor in the second quarter of 2021 through a surface time domain electromagnetic survey. Independent data analysis at the time confirmed the B1 conductor gave a conductance reading of 8 200 Siemens. Kavango’s exploration model is based on identifying drill targets exhibiting conductance readings between 1 000 Siemens and 10 000 Siemens. Meanwhile, Kavango notes that an independent analysis of the down-hole electromagnetic data increased the estimated conductance reading of the B1 conductor to 11 000 Siemens. The explorer also notes that hole KSZDD002 appears to be positioned to intercept the centre of the conductive plate, with the B1 conductor now estimated to be 600 m by 300 m in size. The position and dip of the plate remain the same, indicating the B1 conductor is cross-formational – suggesting the B1 conductor may have been emplaced by an as yet unspecified intrusive event and is unlikely to be formational.
