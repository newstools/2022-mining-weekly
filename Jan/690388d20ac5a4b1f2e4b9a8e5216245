SAO PAULO - Brazilian miner Vale said on Monday it has partially resumed operations in the state of Minas Gerais after being forced to halt some mines a week ago due to heavy rains that increased the risk of accidents and caused logistics disruptions. According to a securities filing, the stoppages caused an impact of about 1.5-million tonnes in Vale's iron-ore production. Still, the company reaffirmed its iron ore production guidance for 2022 at 320-million to 335-million tonnes.
