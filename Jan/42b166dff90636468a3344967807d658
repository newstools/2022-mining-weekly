PERTH (miningweekly.com) – A feasibility study into the Nowa Nowa iron project, in Victoria, has estimated a capital cost of A$15.7-million to support the production of one-million tonnes a year of magnetite direct shipping ore. ASX-listed Eastern Resources on Monday said that the study estimated a life-of-mine of six years, underpinned by a Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant resource of 4.65-million tonnes, at 51.75% iron. The study estimated a pre-tax net present value of A$61.94-million and an internal rate of return of 11.8%. Eastern Resources is now looking to extend the life-of-mine by upgrading the existing resource in the Five Mile deposit, as well as exploring the upside of the Seven Mile project, where iron-ore has been identified. The company would also look to increase the proposed production rate to 1.5-million tonnes a year, and to improve operational efficiencies in order to reduce the expected costs. Eastern Resources is also looking at project partnership opportunities for Nowa Nowa, the company said on Monday.
