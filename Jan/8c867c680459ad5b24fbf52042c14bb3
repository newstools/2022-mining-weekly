SAO PAULO – Brazilian miner Vale said on Monday it has partially halted operations at its Southeastern and South iron-ore systems due to heavy rains that are affecting the state of Minas Gerais, but reiterated 2022 production guidance as the Northern system was not affected. Vale said in a securities filing that train circulation at its Vitoria-Minas railway was partially interrupted following the rains, which led output to be halted at the Brucutu mine and the Mariana complex as it was unable to transport iron-ore from these ventures. Both are located at Vale's Southeastern system - as well as the Itabira complex, which was not affected. At the Southern system, Vale said all of its complexes had to halt production as key highways BR-040 and MG-030 were interdicted. Despite the haltings, Vale added that the Northern System is still operating as planned, and it reiterated its 2022 iron ore production guidance at 320-million to 335-million tonnes. "Vale is taking all measures needed to resume activities and keeping its focus on the safety of employees and communities," the company said. It did not provide a detailed timeframe for operations to be resumed.
