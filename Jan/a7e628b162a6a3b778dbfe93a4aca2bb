TSX-V-listed lithium and copper junior explorer Vision Lithium has started its maiden drilling programme on the newly acquired Cadillac lithium property, 10 km south of the mining town of Cadillac, in the Abitibi region of Quebec, Canada. This follows the successful channel sampling campaign, which returned up to 4.80% lithium oxide over variable widths, with the drilling campaign targeting multiple lithium-bearing dikes on the property. President and CEO Yves Rougerie says Vision Lithium is now mobilising a drill to the site to immediately begin testing the potential of the B dike. “The drill should be operational this week.” The drill will test the B dike along its 300 m exposed strike length, as well as other lithium-bearing dikes, none of which have ever been drilled. Additional results from the surface channel sampling programme are also expected later this month. The Cadillac property is surrounded by infrastructure and skilled labour, being in the middle of Quebec’s mining heartland.

In addition, Vision Lithium has also staked an additional 12 claims to expand the Cadillac property to the east to cover prospective ground.
