Canadian diversified miner Teck Resources will deploy 30 Caterpillar zero-emission trucks at its Elk Valley steelmaking coal operations, in British Columbia, as part of a multi-phase approach to decarbonise its vehicle fleet. The 30-strong fleet, which would include Cat 794 ultra-class trucks, would begin operating at Elk Valley in 2027, the mining company said on Wednesday. Elk Valley is already powered by a 95% clean electricity grid, making it an ideal location to introduce one of Canada’s first zero-emissions large haul truck fleets, with options for trolley-assist technology. “Decarbonising our haul truck fleet is a critical step forward on our road to carbon neutrality and we are pleased to collaborate with Caterpillar to advance this work,” said Teck president and CEO Don Lindsay. Decarbonizing Teck’s vehicle fleet represents a significant reduction in Scope 1 emissions as Teck works towards its goals to reduce the carbon intensity of its operations by 33% by 2030 and be a carbon-neutral operator by 2050.
