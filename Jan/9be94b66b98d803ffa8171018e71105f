Gold sales for the 2021 calendar year also reached a record 295 000 oz, with 86 520 oz sold in the December quarter. “2021 was a record year of production for West African with 289 000 oz produced exceeding the upper-end guidance. The company also achieved record gold sales of over 295 000 oz for the year,’ said West African executive chairperson and CEO Richard Hyde. “To have exceeded 2021 production guidance in what was a very challenging year is a credit to our dedicated team of staff and contractors. I extend my thanks to team members that have spent extended periods away from their families either on site or in quarantine while working for our company during 2021. “We look forward to releasing production and cost guidance for 2022, and updated resources and reserves for Sanbrado and Toega later in the first quarter of 2022. Work on the Kiaka feasibility study is underway and is on track for completion by the end of the second quarter of 2022.”
