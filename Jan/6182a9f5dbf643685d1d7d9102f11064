Exploration and development company Bluejay Mining has appointed Eric Sondergaard to its board as an executive director, with immediate effect. Sondergaard is COO of Bluejay and MD of 100%-owned subsidiary Disko Exploration, which holds base and precious metals licences in Greenland. The board appointment comes at a time when the company is set to embark on major work programmes over the coming years, all aspects of which will be managed by Sondergaard going forward. Sondergaard is a graduate of the University of Calgary in Canada with 15 years' experience in Greenland and Arctic environments. "Eric's appointment follows the successful transition of several of the company's larger projects into mining licences, long-term joint ventures and other value creation milestones, including the Enonkoski JV, the Disko JV and the Metals One spin out,” said CEO Bo Møller Stensgaard. "Eric has been instrumental in consolidating Bluejays' position in Greenland over the last six years and leads engagement with most Greenlandic regulators. Eric's focus will be on the development of the Dundas project and at Disko, as we move towards more active work programmes in the future. I have no doubt that his expertise and knowledge will ensure success on our other major metal projects as we continue to push Dundas towards production and we welcome him to the board."
