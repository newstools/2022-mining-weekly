Aim-listed Katoro has announced that a drill rig has been successfully deployed and that drilling has now started at the Haneti nickel project in Tanzania. Katoro holds a 65% interest in the project, with the balance held by Power Metal Resources. "It is a proud moment for us as a company and our partners to have reached this stage of the Haneti exploration programme and we look forward to receiving results from the drill programme,” says Katoro executive chairperson Louis Coetzee. Earlier this month, Katoro announced that mobilisation for the Haneti diamond drill programme had started. The planned 1 000 m drill programme consists of three deep diamond core targeting magmatic nickel/copper/platinum group element sulphide mineralisation. The work will constitute the first diamond drilling conducted by the joint venture within the Haneti project area. The planned drillholes are designed to provide a full intersection through the various ultramafic sequences to produce fresh rock samples for detailed geochemical and petrographic analysis.
