The case against 87 suspected illegal miners arrested after a deadly shootout with police in Orkney in October has been transferred from the Orkney Magistrate's Court to the Regional Court in Stilfontein, North West. The accused were arrested in Orkney following a shootout with law enforcement officers. They appeared in the Orkney Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, and the case was postponed to 2 March for the continuation of the police investigation, said National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Henry Mamothame. "Following the completion of the status verification of these miners, it was established that all 87 persons have no legal documents to be in South Africa and as such are illegal. They have all abandoned their bail applications. The accused are facing charges of attempted murder, illegal possession of prohibited firearms and ammunition, illegal possession of gold, theft and conspiracy to commit an offence," said Mamothame. During the arrests, when the police descended on the mine shaft, the officers were met with gunfire, News24 previously reported. The shootout resulted in six deaths, and eight of the accused were wounded. "One of the accused is still under police guard, receiving medical attention at a health facility, and the case proceeded in his absence," said Mamothame. At the time of the arrests, police officers recovered two minibuses, illegal mining paraphernalia, gold-bearing material, 11 illegal firearms and bags of food. The group will remain in police custody until their next court appearance.
