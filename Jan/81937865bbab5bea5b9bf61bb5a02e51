PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining has started at the Morila Super Pit, in Mali, with first ore expected during the second quarter of this year. ASX-listed Firefinch on Thursday told shareholders that initial activities comprise pre-stripping of waste from the first stage of the Morila Super Pit, which will continue during the first quarter of 2022. Ore mining is currently forecast to commence during the second quarter, with the Morila Super Pit becoming a consistent source of ore in the second half of 2022. “Morila Super Pit is where the greatest value for the business lies and, as we have done consistently to date, we have successfully delivered on another Morila development milestone,” said Firefinch MD Dr Michael Anderson. “Having previously stated that we’d commence mining at the Morila Super Pit in the first quarter of 2022, we have broken ground in the first week of the quarter. Importantly we are now well set up for 2022; in addition to the fleet that has just commenced work we have a brand new 100 t mining fleet that will be on the go-line next week, and a fleet of larger 150 t units that will be commissioned in the coming months. “Drilling is also ongoing and continues to provide us with increased confidence in the potential at Morila. We look forward to safely developing the Morila Super Pit and generating the full value that Morila the Gorilla has to offer.” The start of mining at the Super Pit represented an important step in Firefinch’s aims to ramp up production at Morila to levels above 100 000 oz/y in 2022.
