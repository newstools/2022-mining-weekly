Trade unions the National Union of Mineworkers, Uasa, Solidarity and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) have rejected precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater’s latest wage offer for employees of its gold operations, insisting instead on their joint proposals and threatening the miner with a “massive strike” in early March. AMCU general secretary Jeff Mphahlele announced during a media briefing on February 24 that the unions would embark on balloting their members at Sibanye’s gold operation on March 1. The votes will determine if members will embark on a strike. Sibanye is offering its gold miners increases of R700 a year, for three years for category 4 to 8 workers, while artisans, miners and officials have been offered increases of 5% each year, for three years. However, the unions – jointly comprising over 30 000 members at Sibanye’s South African gold operations – have jointly asked for increases of 6% a year for three years, or R1 000 a year, and “will not settle for less”. During a joint briefing on February 24, the unions stated they were not asking for “record remuneration”, instead requesting a “market-related” increase. The unions, in mapping out their way forward and preluding the balloting process, have secured the services of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to oversee these processes. The unions and Sibanye have been in negotiations for more than seven months to try to come to an agreement.
