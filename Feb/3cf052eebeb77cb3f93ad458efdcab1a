PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining activities have started at ASX-listed Alara Resources’ Al Wash-hi-Majaza copper/gold project, in Oman. Alara, which holds a 51% interest in the project, on Monday said that the initial mining activities comprise prestripping of waste from the first stage of the operation, with ore mining projected to start in the June quarter of this year. “We are thrilled with the continued good progress being made in the development of the Oman-based Al Wash-hi-Majaza copper project. With initial mining activities, including prestripping of waste material now under way, the project is just months away from becoming an ore-producing mine,” said Alara MD Atmavireshwar Sthapak. “An added bonus is that Alara Resources LLC, an Alara joint venture company in Oman, has been contracted to undertake these works. This contract demonstrates that Alara Resources, in which Alara holds a 35% stake, is establishing itself as a major exploration and mining service provider in the Middle East.” Over the ten-month prestrip period, 4.27-million tonnes of material will be mined, with 250 000 t of material to be mined over the first three months, including 15 600 t of ore.
