Aim-listed Katoro Gold says the diamond drill programme that was carried out at the Haneti project, in Tanzania, has been completed successfully, with a total of 900.04 m completed across three drill holes, as planned. Haneti is held under a joint venture, with Katoro holding 65% and Power Metal Resources 35%. Core logging and sampling is under way, with samples being prepared for thin-section petrographic analysis and laboratory assay testing for nickel, copper, platinum, palladium, cobalt, chromium and gold at SGS Tanzania. Large intersections of serpentinite and gabbroic rocks were identified in the Mwaka drill holes, with indications of peridotitic sequences, the latter subject to confirmation through the thin-section petrographic analysis. The Mihanza drill hole intersected massive serpentinite from surface and serpentinised meta-gabbroic rocks at depth. “The next step of the programme will entail final core logging, sampling and testing of the samples collected from the core. We look forward to updating the market on the results from this,” says CEO Louis Coetzee.
