TSX-V-listed GoviEx Uranium has kicked off its 2022 drilling programme at the polymetallic copper/silver/uranium Falea project, in Mali. The company appointed Foraco Mali to undertake 6 000 m of diamond core drilling, down to 600 m, focusing mainly on targets identified through induced polarisation (IP) surveys conducted in the last two years. These surveys and other analyses highlighted a large chargeable body that is over 2 km long and 500 m wide, underneath the known Falea deposit. The data also suggested a second anomaly with the potential for a chargeable body in the north-east area of the Bala exploration licence area. The Falea project consists of three exploration licences – Falea, Bala and Madini, in south-west Mali – and is situated along strike to a number of gold mines and exploration projects and the Saraya East uranium project, in Senegal. “We are excited to start testing the real potential of Falea and Bala with the 2022 drilling programme. “The IP results and initial samples indicate that our current known resources could be just the tip of the iceberg on this deposit, which already contains 31-million pounds of uranium, 63-million pounds of copper and 21-million ounces of silver,” notes executive chairperson Govind Friedland.
