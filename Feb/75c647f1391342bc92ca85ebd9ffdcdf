TSX-V-listed gold explorer and developer Aton Resources has contracted Capital Drilling to undertake a 5 000 m infill reverse circulation drilling programme at the Hamama West development project at its fully-owned Abu Marawat Concession in the Eastern desert of Egypt. The drilling programme has been designed to upgrade the inferred mineral resource estimate at Hamama West, as Aton advances the project towards its development as an openpit starter mining operation and heap leach processing facility. The campaign is scheduled to start within the next four to six weeks, pending transfer of the drill rig from the Sukari gold mine to Hamama. Sterilisation drilling will also be undertaken for the planned mine infrastructure facilities, as well as at the West Garida prospect 3 km east of Hamama West prospect, which has returned assays of up to 99.6 g/t of gold from surface sampling. Aton interim CEO Tonno Vahk says the explorer has worked with Capital at Hamama since 2016. Meanwhile, Aton also reports that a diamond drilling programme is continuing at Rodruin, with the company expecting to release the next positive tranche of results as soon as they become available. “Aton continues to go full steam ahead on the ground in Egypt, and we are excited by the prospect of a very busy period ahead, drilling at the two projects, as we work to advance both Hamama West and Rodruin towards their development into new gold mines,” he says.
