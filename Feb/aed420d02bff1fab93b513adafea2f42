Coal and heavy minerals miner Exxaro Resources’ Belfast coal mine, in Mpumalanga, has recorded 500 days free of workplace injuries. The newly built Belfast coal mine started producing high-grade thermal coal six months earlier than expected in September 2019. “We completed 2021 without a lost-time injury (LTI), which is a remarkable achievement. We are grateful that our employees and contractors could return to their loved one’s injury free,” said Belfast mine business unit manager Londolani Rampfumedzi. The Belfast team has maintained an overall lost-time injury frequency rate of 0.00, above its target of 0.08. This performance is part of Exxaro’s long-standing record of prioritising mining safety, with the company attributing this latest achievement to its 2019 campaign, Khetha Ukuphepa, which is translated as “Choose Safety”. As part of the campaign, the company has implemented measures to ensure that every employee adheres to strict safety standards and forms part of Exxaro’s goal of zero harm across all its assets. Rampfumedzi said such success could only be achieved by building a culture of safety where every single employee takes accountability for the safety and wellbeing of their colleagues. “We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety and well-being of our people,” said Rampfumedzi. Exxaro health and safety group manager Dr Joseph Matjila said Belfast Coal was an example of what could be achieved through collective teamwork. “It is encouraging to witness first-hand the hard work and dedication that the leadership have shown in implementing the strategic initiatives to improve safety practices so that every employee can work in an environment in which they can be trusted to be safe. I am incredibly proud of the Belfast team,” he added. Matjila called on all stakeholders to continue to prioritise worker safety to reach the next target – 1 095 LTI-free days.
