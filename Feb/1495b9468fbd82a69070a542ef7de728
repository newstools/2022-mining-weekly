PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Tigers Realm Coal has warned of delays in the construction of its coal handling and process plant (CHPP) at its Amaam coal project, in Russia. The company told shareholders that mining operations in the far-eastern Russian province of Chukotka were continuing unabated, despite the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine. However, the company noted that overseas equipment and service providers have raised concerns around on-site visits, which Tigers Realm said would impact the completion date of the CHPP. The company and suppliers are looking at alternative commissioning options such as remote oversight of installation of electronic and IT componentry. “In the circumstances of a possible delay in the full commissioning of the CHPP and the uncertainty that we face in the current environment, our coal production and sales plan is being reviewed for the coming months,” Tigers Realm said on Monday.
