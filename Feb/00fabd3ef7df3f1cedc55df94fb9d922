Aim-listed Shanta Gold has discovered new high-grade resources at its West Kenya project, in Kenya. The company aims to announce a consolidated upgraded mineral resource estimate for West Kenya, which incorporates new discoveries at the Isulu and Bushiangala targets, as well as new maiden resource estimates for the Ramula and Bumbo targets, following encouraging results in the district. Shanta says it hit promising gold intersections from 31 000 m of drilling conducted at West Kenya in 2021. Results have been consistently high grade and extend from surface down through at least 500 m deep, and open from all angles. The company identified visible gold in 38 intersections across 107 holes drilled last year. The company also remains on track to start producing gold at the Singida project, in Tanzania, early next year. In the meantime, Shanta plans on drilling 42 000 m at West Kenya in 2022.
