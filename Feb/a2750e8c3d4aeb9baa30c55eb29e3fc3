PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Coronado Global Resources will take on management and operation of four mining fleets from contractor Thiess at its Curragh North mining area, which is part of the greater Curragh Complex, in Queensland. The arrangements will see Coronado manage and operate three of the fleets supplied by Thiess, who will continue to own the equipment and perform maintenance. Thiess will also maintain the Coronado-owned and -managed fourth electric shovel fleet. The company said on Wednesday that the new arrangements will contribute to Coronado’s focus to continue the progress made to drive operational performance and compliance to the mine plan, thereby ensuring increased coal availability. Thiess has provided mining services to Curragh North since 2004 and will continue to operate five excavator fleets under the existing long-term mining services contract which expires at the end of December 2025. The two companies are working towards finalising the relevant agreements. The new arrangements between the parties will commence from April 1, but the transition will be phased over the next few months. Coronado said that the changes signal the focus the company has on its future and on attracting and retaining the skills needed to secure success, and would not result in any changes to other contracts or supplier arrangements at Curragh.
