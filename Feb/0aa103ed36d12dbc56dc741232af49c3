The German government is planning to transfer hydrogen production technology to African countries amid its efforts to quit coal and nuclear energy, a German government official said on Wednesday. Germany will have to import 40% to 60% of the hydrogen it needs for its energy transformation plans, the official said ahead of a meeting between the African Union and the European Union scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday in Brussels.
