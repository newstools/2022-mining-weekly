London-listed Petra Diamonds says it has successfully closed sales for about 80% of the volume of diamonds on offer during its fourth tender cycle for its 2022 financial year ending June 30. About 589 100 ct have been sold for $110-million, at an average price of $188/ct. No exceptional diamonds were sold as part of these sales. The sale of the remaining 20% of volume for the fourth tender cycle is scheduled to close on March 7, which will be followed by the release of full sales results of the tender shortly after.
