The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) has announced the appointment of former Xstrata Nickel executive Ian Pearce as its incoming president-elect. He will assume the role in May 2024, following Michael Cinnamond (2023 to 2024) and Anne Marie Toutant (2022 to 2023). The CIM states that the role of incoming president-elect is a dynamic position that will see Pearce work closely with the president and president-elect to provide direction to CIM that will ensure it continues to be a leading not-for-profit technical society of professionals in the Canadian minerals, metals, materials and energy industries. Current president Pierre Julien says Pearce brings global mining experience to CIM. “Ian is a proven leader, mine builder, innovator and advocate for diversity and inclusion in our industry. His broad experience and insights will further strengthen CIM’s executive team and its ability to execute its vision to be a trusted authority and collective source for advancing the mineral industry towards a sustainable future,” says Julien. Toutant adds that Pearce’s passion for connecting people and innovating across the breadth of the mining lifecycle combined with his experience in engineering, technology, sustainability and high-level project management roles will be invaluable to CIM. With more than 35 years of experience as a leader and innovator within the mining industry, Pearce has a deep understanding of the challenges faced by the mining sector. He has held senior engineering and project management roles at Fluor and executive roles at Falconbridge and Xstrata Nickel. He currently serves as chair of the board of MineSense Technologies, chair of the board of New Gold, and nonexecutive director at Metso Outotec, Northland Power and NextSource Materials. Pearce is also a senior adviser at KoBold Metals and Electrasteel.
