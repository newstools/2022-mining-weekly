Aim-listed Red Rock Resources says it finds itself in the unusual position of expecting a combination of gold, copper and cobalt drilling results from six targets in three countries over coming weeks. Red Rock has gold exploration assets in Kenya, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Australia, and a copper/cobalt exploration asset in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The company is also imminently expecting the listing of investee company Elephant Oil Corporation, a group in which it has been a longstanding shareholder, in the US. Red Rock expects drill results for 2 093 m of drilling undertaken in the latter half of last year at the 100%-owned Mikei gold project, in Kenya; 2 469 m of drilling done in the same period at the 80%-owned Luanshimba project in the DRC; and a six-hole programme at the 50.1%-owned New Ballarat project in Victoria, Australia. The company plans to analyse and announce the results as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Red Rock says its joint venture partner, Juno Minerals, on the Mt Ida gold project, in Australia, plans to soon complete a feasibility study on that project.
