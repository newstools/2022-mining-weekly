Platinum group metals (PGMs) development company Wesizwe Platinum on February 8 informed shareholders that community protests have interrupted the development of its Bakubung mine. It noted that Ledig community members on January 26 embarked on a march towards the Bakubung mine. The marchers blocked the mine entrance and through the Kgosi – the community chief – delivered a memorandum of demand to the mine. "For the safety of our employees and mine property, the construction of the mine was suspended. Bakubung is currently in a critical stage of project construction. The construction of the mining and concentrate processing system has not yet been completed and the schedule of the construction is tight with high targets. "The forced closure seriously affects the progress of the project, causing Wesizwe to suffer huge economic losses, and this has a serious impact on the employment of local community members, construction contractors and subcontractors," Wesizwe pointed out. It further noted that, after the community march, the company urgently engaged with the Ledig community, through its leadership, to find a solution to the community's demands and resume construction of the project. Formal negotiations were held with the community on January 27 and an agreement was signed off by the Kgosi and Wesizwe's CEO; however, on January 31, further demands were made against the mine. On February 4, a meeting was held between management and community leaders. Despite Wesizwe having secured a court interdict on January 31, intimidation of the Bakubung workforce has continued. Mine property has also been damaged. "Management are working tirelessly to ensure a safe start-up of Bakubung as soon as possible," Wesizwe assured shareholders.
