JSE-listed Tharisa has signed a comprehensive memorandum of understanding (MoU) with renewable energy independent power producer Total Eren and Africa-focused transitional energy company Chariot. The MoU, which is a precursor to the signing of a long-term power purchase agreement for the supply of electricity on a take-or-pay basis, envisages the partners developing, financing, building, owning, operating and maintaining a solar photovoltaic project that will supply power to the Tharisa mine, on the western limb of the Bushveld Complex. The plant is anticipated to initially provide 40 MW and will adequately cover the mine’s current energy requirements. In September 2021, Tharisa outlined its commitment to reduce its carbon emissions by 30% by 2030 and become net carbon neutral by 2050. The reduction in the use of grid power by the Tharisa mine will be accelerated through the implementation of this and other renewable energy projects. "We are very pleased to be entering into this MoU with Tharisa. Through our partnership with Chariot, we are keen to assist mining companies in Africa to reduce their carbon intensity and energy costs, via implementing renewable power solutions into their operations,” says Total Eren business development global head and executive VP Fabienne Demol.
