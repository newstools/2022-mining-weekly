PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Energy provider Meridian Energy on Tuesday confirmed that it was not in discussions with the owners of the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter, in New Zealand, despite reports that project owner Rio Tinto was looking to extend the project life beyond 2024. New Zealand’s public broadcaster, RNZ reported on Tuesday that Rio was investigating the long-term future for the aluminium operation. "With a global strategy focused on decarbonisation and growth (released in October last year) Rio Tinto does see a positive pathway for New Zealand's Aluminium Smelter (NZAS) to continue operating and contributing to the local and national economies beyond 2024," NZAS CEO Chris Blenkiron was quoted as saying. "We are working closely with Ngāi Tahu, Southland and key industry leaders to find the best way to achieve this." Rio in 2020 announced the conclusion of a strategic review of the smelter and a decision to wind down operations by August 2021 owing to high energy and transmission costs. Following negotiations resulting in a new electricity agreement, in January 2021, the company and its joint venture partner Sumitomo Chemical Company, committed to continue operating the smelter for an additional four years until December 2024. Meridian, which provides electricity to the operation, on Tuesday told shareholders that it was not in discussions with NZAS about a new electricity contract, confirming that the existing contract would end on December 31, 2024. The Tiwai smelter employs 995 staff, produced 335 405 t of saleable aluminium in 2020, and generated $600-million export earnings.
