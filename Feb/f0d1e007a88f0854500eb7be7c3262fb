Nickel prices rose on Friday to their highest levels in three-and-a-half weeks after the market was bolstered by lower inventories and as the prospect of sanctions on Russia, a major producer of the metal, exacerbated concerns of reduced supply. Three-month nickel on the London Metal Exchange CMNI3 rose 0.9% to $24 095 a tonne, after hitting its highest level since January 24. The metal climbed 4.4% so far this week, set for its biggest weekly gain in four. The most-traded March nickel contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed 2.9% to 178 220 yuan ($28 140.15) a tonne. Stocking supply concerns, the European Union is ready to present a tough package of sanctions as soon as needed, as Russian troops inch closer to Ukraine, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said on Thursday. Russia's Norilsk Nickel supplies about 10% of the world's nickel output. Nickel stocks in LME-registered warehouses were at their lowest since December 2019 at 83 736 tonnes, while premium for cash nickel over the three-month contract rose to $368 a tonne. FUNDAMENTALS
