PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Calidus Resources has started commissioning at its Warrawoona gold project, in Western Australia, with the project remaining on target and on budget. Calidus MD Dave Reeves said the start of commissioning was a major milestone for the company. “With first gold now forecast to be less than ten weeks away, we are about to make the pivotal transition from developer to profitable gold producer. “This immense achievement is a credit to all employees and contractors, who have worked tirelessly amid some of the most challenging weather conditions and times our industry has faced.” Warrawoona is expected to produce up to 105 000 oz of gold a year, but could potentially produce up to 139 000 oz/y when the nearby Blue Spec deposit is developed. Crushing and milling operations are set to start within the next eight weeks with first gold poured approximately two weeks later.
