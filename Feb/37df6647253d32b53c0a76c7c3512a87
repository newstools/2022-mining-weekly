West Africa-focused gold company Cora Gold plans to start a new drill programme at its flagship Sanankoro project, in southern Mali, which comprises five contiguous permits encompassing 439 km2. An initial programme of 7 500 m of reverse circulation drilling has been planned to be undertaken by drilling company Capital. The drilling campaign is intended to increase resource confidence by converting existing inferred resources to the indicated category, as well as to discover new inferred resources. This will build on the pit-constrained mineral resource estimate reported by mining consultancy CSA Global in November 2021, which identified a resource of 21.9-million tonnes of gold at a grade of 1.15 g/t for a total of 809 300 oz. This estimate includes 540 600 oz at a grade of 1.33 g/t gold in the indicated category and 268 700 oz, grading 0.9 g/t gold, in the inferred category. This estimate represented a 200% increase in total ounces from the maiden mineral resource estimate published in December 2019. The estimate comprises 67% of ounces in the indicated category, with 77% gold in the oxide zone, with a further 22% in the transitional zone, thereby giving Cora further confidence in its ability to deliver an openpit free-digging oxide operation. Previous metallurgical test work shows 94% recoveries, while the base of oxidation ranges from 60 m to 207 m deep. Further, Cora reports that work on the definitive feasibility study is gaining momentum following completion of all related fieldwork in January and is expected to be released before the end of the June. Cora notes that significant further expansion potential remains as all deposits remain open at depth and along strike.
