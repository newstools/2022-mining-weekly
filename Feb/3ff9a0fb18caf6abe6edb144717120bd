PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Zinc miner New Century Resources has reconfirmed its production target of between 110 000 t and 130 000 t of zinc for 2022, at C1 costs of between $0.85/lb and $0.95/lb, following the restart of its ball mill, at the Century zinc mine, in Queensland. The ball mill motor was impacted by severe weather in January, resulting in operations continuing at the site with the ball mill in bypass for this period. New Century on Monday reported that the damaged ball mill motor was repaired off site and had now been returned to operation. The company’s spare rotable motor continues to undergo its scheduled refurbishment works and is expected back on site in late March or early April. In addition, a new custom-built, contemporary designed motor is on order and will become the duty unit upon arrival at the Century mine later this year, ensuring the availability of multiple critical spares and greater long-term reliability from this area of the processing plant infrastructure.
