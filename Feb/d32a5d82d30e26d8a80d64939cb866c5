Commenting on the statistics, Nedbank Group Economic Unit said the impact of the Omicron variant and associated lockdowns across the globe was evident in the December numbers, with lower production and sales from a month earlier. “The surge in output during 2021 is unlikely to be repeated this year, mainly due to easing commodity prices and softer global demand, particularly from China. “Furthermore, unreliable electricity supply, wage disputes and developments of new Covid-19 variants also pose significant downside risks to the outlook. “However, a weakening rand exchange rate will provide some buffer to profit margins,” it notes.
