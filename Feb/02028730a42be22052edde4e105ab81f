JSE-listed Gold Fields expects to report headline earnings a share of between $0.88 and $0.94 for the year ended December 31. That represents an increase of between 6% and 13% year-on-year. Normalised earnings a share are expected to be between $1.02 and $1.08, which is between 2% and 8% higher than the normalised earnings of $1 apiece reported for the year ended December 31, 2020. Attributable gold equivalent production for the year was about 2.34-million ounces, a 5% increase year-on-year and at the upper end of the guidance range. All-in costs (AIC) will come in higher at about $1 297/oz (or $1 236/oz at 2020 exchange rates), compared with an AIC of $1 079/oz posted for the prior year, owing to increased capital expenditure at the Salares Norte project, in Chile. Gold Fields will publish its full-year results on February 17.
