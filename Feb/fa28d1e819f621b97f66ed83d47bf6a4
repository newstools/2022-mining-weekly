Top copper miner Codelco has committed to have all its sites participate in the copper assurance programme on responsible practices by the end of next year, with the El Teniente site, in Chile, set to be the first of the group to participate in the Copper Mark. The Copper Mark is an assurance framework to promote responsible practices and demonstrate the copper industry’s contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. “The commitment from Codelco to our framework is indicative of a wider trend we are seeing from copper producers, who are responding to ESG demand from investors and customers to adopt more responsible production practices that we expect to continue to grow as part of the shift towards creating a greener economy,” said Copper Mark executive director Michèle Brülhart. The announcement is also in line with Codelco’s growing commitment to demonstrate responsible and sustainable production practices across its global operations. The company’s participation in the Copper Mark framework builds on its commitment to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 70% and decrease its consumption of continental waters by 65% by 2030, as well as achieve carbon neutrality across its operations by 2050. Codelco VP of corporate affairs and sustainability Renato Fernández commented that the Copper Mark represented an external and independent validation of the group’s route towards processes with less impact. Codelco joins several other producers that have also signed up to Copper Mark, including Antofagasta, Aurubus, BHP, Freeport McMoRan, KGHM and Rio Tinto.
