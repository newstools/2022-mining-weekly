PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Andromeda Metals has declared its off-market takeover offer for fellow listed Minotaur Exploration to be unconditional. The two companies in December announced a merger to create an Australian kaolin/halloysite and technology company, consolidating ownership of the Great White kaolin project, in South Australia. Under the terms of the agreement struck this week, Andromeda would acquire Minotaur through a unanimously recommended off-market takeover offer, offering 1.15 of its own shares for every one Minotaur share held. Following the transaction, Minotaur shareholders would hold a 19.5% interest in the enlarged Andromeda, with Andromeda expected to have a market capitalisation of A$552-million. With the offer now declared unconditional, Minotaur shareholders have been urged to accept the offer, which closes on February 25. Andromeda currently holds a 79.16% interest in Minotaur.
