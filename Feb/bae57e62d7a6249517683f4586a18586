PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Caprice Resources will raise A$2-million through a share placement to institutional and sophisticated investors. The company on Friday reported that 11.6-million shares, at a price of 16c each, would be placed to raise the funds. The placement will be done under Caprice’s existing placement capacity, and will not require shareholder approval. “We are delighted with the strong support received from both new and existing investors. The capital raise will assist us to grow the company via a sustained period of drilling across a number of projects and prospects. Combined with geophysics, soil sampling and other on-ground activities, we expect a sustained period of newsflow over the coming months,” said MD Andrew Muir. Funds raised will be used to advance exploration at the Murchison gold project and the Northampton base metals project, including aircore drilling on Lake Austin, reverse circulation drilling on The Island, and aircore drilling at Cuddingwarra West and Fleece Pool.
