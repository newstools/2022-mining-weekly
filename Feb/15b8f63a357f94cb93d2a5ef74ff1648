PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Lotus Resources has reported a 23% increase in the mineral resource estimate of the Kayelekera uranium project, in Malawi. The project is now estimated to host 46.3-million pounds of uranium, at 500 parts per million (ppm) uranium oxide (U3O8). Measured and indicated resources now account for 81% of the total mineral resource estimate. “This is a meaningful increase with the majority of material classified in the Indicated category, which indicates that the life-of-mine (LoM) could increase by more than two years when the new mine plan is completed in the coming months,” said Lotus MD Keith Bowes. “These drill results have also given us confidence that the Kayelekera mineralised zones can still be expanded and this will be considered in future programmes. “While a portion of the updated mineral resource estimate is a result of the recent exploration success at the Kayelekera project, the majority of material was included due to decreasing the cut-off grade from 300 ppm to 200 ppm. We are comfortable with this revised cut-off grade given the success to date from our ore sorting test work on material from the project, as well as the continuing strengthening of fundamentals for the sector, including higher uranium prices. “While the majority of management time is now fully focused on the definitive feasibility study, exploration results from the nearby Livingstonia uranium deposit are expected shortly. Assuming success, an inaugural Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource estimate for Livingstonia will be completed, meaning a further increase in the global mineral resource estimate is likely.”
