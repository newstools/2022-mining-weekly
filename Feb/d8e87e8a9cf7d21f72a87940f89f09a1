TSX-V- and LSE-listed Pure Gold Mining on Thursday announced the appointment of mining engineer Terry Smith as COO and Bryan Wilson as VP mine GM. Smith and Wilson would work closely with Maryse Belanger, who was previously mine GM, to ensure a smooth transition in the roles of COO and VP mine GM, the company stated. Belanger was recently appointed chairperson of midtier miner Iamgold, but remains on the board of Pure Gold. She said in a statement that she remained committed to Pure Gold and the PureGold mine, in Red Lake, Ontario, and that she would support Wilson not only as his predecessor, but as director of the company. Further, Pure Gold promoted Phil Smerchanski to VP exploration and technical services. In this expanded role, he will work closely with Smith and Wilson in supporting the technical services team at the mine site.
