Aim-listed Hummingbird Resources has received and analysed a further 12 000 m of assays from the SE deposit at the Yanfolila gold mine, in Mali, after conducting 48 000 m of drilling last year. About 17 700 m of drilling was conducted on the SE deposit. The company says results for this deposit continue to show significant grade and extension at depth, as evidenced by holes containing 4 m of gold, grading 64.68 g/t from 63 m and 18 m of gold, grading 5.13 g/t from 7 m. These and historical drill results highlight the upside potential to SE’s current resources and reserves profile of 204 000 oz and 100 300 oz, respectively, and provide an increasing level of confidence in the overall geology of the SE deposit as a key future deposit to be mined at Yanfolila. “Overall the drill programme has demonstrated the significant upside to extend the life-of-mine at Yanfolila on existing known deposits, coupled with upside from our greenfield deposits still only in their infancy. “The results from the SE drilling are particularly encouraging, shoring up our confidence that SE will be a key future minable deposit at Yanfolila for the years ahead. This all is a positive step as we move towards our strategic goal of achieving a more than ten-year reserve mine life at Yanfolila,” says CEO Dan Betts.
