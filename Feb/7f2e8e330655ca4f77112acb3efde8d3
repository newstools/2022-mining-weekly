TSX-V-listed Giyani Metals Corporation has announced an updated mineral resource estimate for the K.Hill manganese project, in Botswana, which states a 31% increase in indicated resources and a 121% increase in inferred resources for the project. The new estimate incorporates a southerly extension of the K.Hill deposit, called K.Hill Extension, which underwent reverse circulation drilling in 2021. The indicated resource now comprises 2.1-million tonnes grading 19.3% manganese oxide, for 401 000 t of contained manganese oxide or about one-million tonnes of high-purity manganese sulphate monohydrate (HPMSM), before processing recoveries are applied. The inferred resources amount to 3.1-million tonnes at an average grade of 16.9% manganese oxide, equating to about 530 000 t of contained manganese oxide or about 1.3-million tonnes of HPMSM. The project will be developed to produce HPMSM, a precursor chemical used in the manufacturing of rechargeable battery cathodes for electric vehicles. Giyani is conducting infill drilling across the K.Hill Extension area to upgrade inferred resource material to indicated resources, which is expected to be completed late in the first half of the year. The company continues progressing metallurgical test work for a feasibility study on the project.
