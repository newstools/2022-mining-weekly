PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Construction has started at the Mardie salt and potash project, in the Pilbara. ASX-listed BCI Minerals on Friday announced that the company had now secured all secondary approvals for the main construction, including a mining proposal approval by the Department of Mines, Industry, Regulation and Safety, the Part V Works Approval granted by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation and all necessary consents under Section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act. “This is a historic milestone for BCI and the culmination of four years’ work by our dedicated team. Mardie will ultimately include a 100 km2 evaporation pond and crystalliser system, two processing plants and a new export facility which will produce 5.35-million tonnes a year of salt and 140 000 t/y of sulphate of potash fertiliser, driven sustainably by inexhaustible seawater and 99% natural sun and wind energy,” said BCI MD Alwyn Vorster. “We aim to complete construction of Pond 1 and fill it with seawater within six months which will represent the commencement of production and keep us on track to achieve first salt sales in late 2024.” The A$913-million project is expected to have a mine life of at least 60 years.
