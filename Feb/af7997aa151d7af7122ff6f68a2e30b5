Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson on Thursday endorsed the Pan-Canadian Geoscience Strategy, outlining Canada’s intention to produce world-leading geoscience to improve the competitiveness of its mining and metals industry. The strategy represents a renewed commitment to improving collaboration and the availability and accessibility of public geoscience data and knowledge. Accessible geoscience data can help lower exploration costs, inform evidence-based land-use decisions and support geohazard risk management and climate change mitigation. The strategy identifies five priority areas, which seek to increase the impact of geoscience by supporting robust science and data, developing skilled scientists, and growing exploration and collaboration, all of which will support Canada’s critical minerals strategy that is currently under development. "Canada has the resources and the expertise to lead the world in producing, processing and growing value chains for critical minerals. The Pan-Canadian Geoscience Strategy, codeveloped by federal, provincial and territorial geological survey organisations, will help propel the sector forward,” commented Wilkinson.
