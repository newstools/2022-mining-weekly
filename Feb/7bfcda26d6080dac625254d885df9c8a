PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major BHP has welcomed the world’s first liquefied natural gas- (LNG-) fuelled Newcastlemax bulk carrier, which will transport iron-ore between Western Australia and Asia from 2022. The miner previously chartered five LNG-fuelled bulk carriers from Eastern Pacific Shipping (EPS) for a period of five years, with the aim of reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by more than 30% per voyage. The MV Mt, Tourmaline’s maiden voyage saw her arrive at Jurong Port in Singapore for her first LNG bunkering operation, which will take place through the first LNG bunker vessel in Singapore, the FueLNG Bellina. FueLNG, a joint venture between Shell Eastern Petroleum and Keppel Offshore & Marine, operates the bunker vessel. After LNG bunkering, the 209 000-deadweight tonne vessel will leave for Port Hedland in Western Australia for iron-ore loading operations. “BHP works with our suppliers to embed innovative and sustainable solutions in our supply chain. This vessel delivers significant improvements to energy efficiency and emissions intensity, as well as reduced overall GHG emissions in our value chain. These achievements demonstrate BHP, EPS and Shell’s shared commitment to social value through innovative emissions reduction initiatives,” BHP chief commercial officer Vandita Pant said. “These LNG-fuelled vessels are expected to reduce GHG emissions intensity by more than 30% on a per voyage basis compared to a conventional fuelled voyage and will contribute towards our 2030 goal to support 40% emissions intensity reduction of BHP-chartered shipping of our products.”
