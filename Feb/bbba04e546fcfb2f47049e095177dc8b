Aim-listed West Africa-focussed gold explorer Oriole Resources has appointed chartered accountant Eileen Carr to its board as nonexecutive chairperson, effective February 17. She will succeed John McGloin, who has been appointed CEO of TSX-V-listed Diamond Fields Resources. Carr, with over 30 years of experience within the resources sector, has worked worldwide on a host of large-scale mining operations, starting as FD of Cluff Resources from 1993; and has, since then, held several executive directorships in the resources sector, including Monterrico Metals CFO. Her first nonexecutive role was for Banro Corporation in 1998 and, more recently, Carr held a nonexecutive director position for Bacanora Lithium. In addition, she has been a Sylvania Platinum nonexecutive director since May 2015. Oriole CEO Tim Livesey says the past three years have been transformational for the company. “Our market capitalisation has more than doubled and we have also seen a significant advancement of our Senegalese asset, the development of our new frontier exploration targets in Cameroon and the rationalisation across the legacy assets leading to significant reductions in general and administrative [activities].” He adds that this significant progress occurred under McGloin’s stewardship and guidance. “I would like to thank him personally, and on behalf of [Oriole], for his help in steering the company during this period. We wish him well with his future endeavours.”

“We are delighted that [Carr] has agreed to join the group later this month . . . with [her] extensive experience of the mining industry and previous board positions, she will help us to continue the successful development of the company’s portfolio,” says Livesey.
