ASX- and Aim-listed Aura Energy has announced it is now included on the prominent uranium and nuclear investor service The Global X Uranium exchange-traded fund (ETF). Global X has $1.16-billion worth of assets under management and provides investors access to a range of companies involved in uranium mining and the production of nuclear components. The ETF seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Global Uranium & Nuclear Components Total Return Index. “We expect that the inclusion will raise awareness for the company in the global investment community. “Aura continues to build a presence as a developer in the uranium sector and we expect that this inclusion will lead to introductions to new investors and possible partners for the company and our projects,” states Aura acting CEO Dr Will Goodall.
