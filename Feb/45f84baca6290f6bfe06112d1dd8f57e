PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Critical Resources will raise A$12.5-million through a share placement to fund exploration work at its Mavis Lake and Halls Peak lithium and base metals projects, in New South Wales. The ASX-listed company on Thursday said that it would place 147-million shares, at a price of 8.5c each, to sophisticated and institutional investors under its existing placement capacity. “This capital raise is a step-change for the company in terms of future development opportunities. Funds will allow the company to execute its strategy and continue its aggressive exploration activities already underway at Halls Peak in New South Wales, and furthermore across its newly acquired Mavis Lake and Graphic Lake lithium projects in Canada,” said Critical Resources MD Alex Biggs. “This level of funding really does allow us to fast-track and accelerate our exploration strategies across our projects, which is an exciting value proposition for our shareholders.”
