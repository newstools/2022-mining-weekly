PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Dual-listed copper developer Orion Minerals has made a "significant" copper discovery within its Okiep copper project, in South Africa. The ASX- and JSE-listed company on Thursday said that the first diamond drill hole to test one of several SkyTem geophysical anomalies had intersected mafic-intrusive-hosted copper sulphide mineralisation over a drill width of 10 m from 31.72 m down-hole. “This exciting discovery at the Nous prospect provides early validation of our exploration methodology for the Okiep district. Remarkably, this is the first discovery in the district in more than 40 years, and it is directly attributable to the use of modern geophysics, followed by mapping and detailed ground surveys,” said Orion MD and CEO Errol Smart. “Our early exploration success underscores the huge potential upside in the Okiep region, where geological records and mining history show that many orebodies either have no outcrop or have only minor showings at surface, as in this case.” Smart said that targets three and four have now been re-ranked to top priority and fast-tracked for drilling, owing to the discovery of oxides at target four, along with other key structural alteration indicators on surface over the entire Nous prospect area. “What is really exciting, however, is that a further eight selected high priority SkyTem targets that are currently being followed up with systematic ground surveys at the Okiep copper project will be drilled over the next 12 to 24 months. The potential for new discoveries and significant additions to what is already an area with enormous copper endowment, is huge,” said Smart.
