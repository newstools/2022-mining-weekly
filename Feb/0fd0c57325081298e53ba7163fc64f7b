TSX-listed Liberty Gold Corporation has secured water rights in excess of 2 300 acre-feet a year in the area of Black Pine, which will supply the operation in future. Preliminary engineering studies suggest that this water supply is sufficient to sustain up to a 70 000 t/d of gold ore, run-of-mine heap leach operation and associated infrastructure at Black Pine. “We are pursuing multiple strategies for procurement of additional water rights given the potential scale of the new Rangefront discovery and to provide operational flexibility to a future mining operation,” says COO Jon Gilligan. Additionally, the company has obtained a mineral rights lease from the State of Idaho covering 2.6 km2 adjacent to the Black Pine deposit, representing an exploration opportunity and an area to build heap leach infrastructure. The Liberty Gold land holdings at Black Pine, in the northern Great basin of Idaho. “Key deliverables for the development team have been securing a reliable and sustainable long-term water supply and identifying additional land for the potential location of infrastructure for the future Black Pine mining operation. “We are delighted to be partnering with the state and local communities to achieve this outcome. Liberty Gold will continue to conduct technical studies on this future groundwater supply to ensure we manage the water resources in the basin in a sustainable manner, minimising potential impacts and maximizing benefits for stakeholders,” states Gilligan.
