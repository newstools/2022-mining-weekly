ASX- and Aim-listed Aura Energy has started a regional exploration programme to enhance the resources of its Tiris uranium project, in Mauritania. The company confirms that the programme will start in the coming months and will be conducted by a drilling contractor. “We will focus on expanding the existing measured and indicated resources and locate additional exploration targets that have been underexplored. “We look forward to starting the programme as soon as the necessary approvals are in place, as we continue to advance towards low-emission uranium production at Tiris,” says acting CEO Dr Will Goodall. Currently, the uranium resource estimate stands at 49-million pounds of uranium oxide from 66-million tonnes, grading 334 parts per million uranium oxide. Meanwhile, resource estimation work is also under way by independent consultants to enable a vanadium resource statement to be declared, separate from the uranium resource estimate and independent of the uranium resource upgrade work.
