PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Potash developer BCI Minerals has been granted a mining lease for its Mardie salt and potash project, in Western Australia. The mining lease is valid for an initial 21-years until February 2042, with a further extension term available, subject to Ministerial approval. “Securing the mining leases is a watershed moment for BCI. It follows four years of studies, surveys, consultation, access agreements and approvals and evidences our strong relationship across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Main construction is set to commence imminently following secondary approvals, which keeps our target for first salt sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 on track and in sight,” said BCI MD Alwyn Vorster. The A$913-million project is expected to produce some 5.35-million tonnes a year of salt and some 140 000 t/y sulphate of potash, over a projected mine life of at least 60 years. BCI expects construction to start in early 2022, subject to securing secondary statutory approvals. First sulphate of potash sales are expected by the first quarter of 2026.
