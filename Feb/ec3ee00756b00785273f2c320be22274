Dual-listed Skeena Resources will appeal a decision made by the British Columbia Chief Gold Commissioner that the materials in the Albina Lake storage facility at the Eskay Creek gold/silver project belong to an individual holding a claim on the lands that underlie the facility. Richard Mills in August last year applied to the commissioner for a determination as to the ownership of the minerals in the materials deposits in the storage facility by the previous operators of the past-producing Eskay Creek mine.
 
Skeena said on Tuesday that it believed the Chief Gold Commissioner’s decision was in error and that it would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of British Columbia in accordance with the appeal provisions in the BC Mineral Tenure Act.
 
“It is incomprehensible to us that the Chief Gold Commissioner of British Columbia would transfer ownership of materials that Skeena and, prior to that, Barrick, have actively managed and environmentally monitored for decades in the Albino Lake storage facility to an individual who staked barren mineral claims below the facility. We feel this sets a grave precedent for mineral exploration, development, and environmental liability management in British Columbia,” said president and CEO Walter Coles. Skeena is currently advancing a full feasibility study for Eskay Creek and will complete it in 2022.
