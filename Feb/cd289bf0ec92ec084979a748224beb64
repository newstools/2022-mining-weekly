JSE-listed Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) expects its headline earnings for the year ended December 31, to be between 146% and 166% higher year-on-year at between R74.8-billion and R80.8-billion. This compares with headline earnings of R30.3-billion reported for 2020. This translates to headline earnings per share (HEPS) growth to between R284.35 and R307.16, compared with HEPS of R115.54 in 2020. Basic earnings are likely to be between R74-billion and R80.7-billion and earnings per share (EPS) between R283.97 and R306.78, compared with EPS of R115.53 apiece. Amplats says the earnings increase was driven by a 22% higher rand basket price and an 82% increase in platinum group metal sales volumes – which was owing to processing in built up inventory. The company will publish its results on February 21.
