PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Talga Resources has produced Europe’s first battery anode with the commissioning of its Electric Vehicle Anode (EVA) qualification plant, in Sweden. The maiden production of Talnode-C, as part of kiln commissioning, represents a significant step for Talga and the emerging green European battery industry, the company said on Thursday. Talnode-C has the lowest carbon-equivalent profile in the world for coated anode. “It is significant to be the first to produce lithium-ion battery anode in Europe, and to have done it using our in-house graphite mining, processing, and coating technologies is a testimony to the hard work of our team, Swerim, and the support of our shareholders and stakeholders,” said Talga MD Mark Thompson. “With Talnode-C demonstrated to be the lowest emission anode in the world, I strongly believe it holds the best promise for local, greener batteries to be produced for the major shift to electrification now underway.” Following the completion of plant commissioning, Talnode-C will be shipped to battery cell makers to undergo next stage commercial testing. To date, Talga has received engagements from 23 battery manufacturers and major automotive original equipment manufacturers for Talnode-C produced at the EVA plant. EVA plant commissioning is progressing on time and within budget, with full commissioning scheduled for completion in late March and official opening of the plant occurring in early April 2022.
