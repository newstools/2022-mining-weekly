PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Mincor Resources has delivered a maiden parcel of high-grade nickel ore from its Northern operations at the Kambalda nickel project, to diversified miner BHP’s Nickel West Kambalda nickel concentrator. The company on Tuesday said that this marked a key milestone towards the resumption of production from the Kambalda operations. This is the first time ore has been trucked from a Mincor mine to the concentrator in over six years, and signals the start of the stockpile build ahead of the commissioning of the concentrator in the June 2022 quarter. “This is another fantastic achievement for our team as we close-in on first nickel concentrate production, which remains on track to be achieved next quarter. It’s a significant moment for everyone involved with Mincor to see high-grade nickel ore being hauled from one of our mines to the Kambalda nickel concentrator,” said Mincor MD David Southam. “With the current nickel price substantially above the assumed price used in our definitive feasibility study, we are incredibly excited to be on the cusp of production once again in Kambalda.” Mincor in 2020 approved the A$68-million development of the Kambalda project, with the project forecast to produce 71 000 t of nickel and 5 000 t of copper over a five-year mine life. The Kambalda operations consist of the Cassini and Northern operations, at the start, with the Miitel mine contributing at the back half of the project life. The flagship Cassini mine will contribute 56% of the total nickel-in-concentrate production over the initial life of the project.
